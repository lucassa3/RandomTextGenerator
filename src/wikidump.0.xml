It is felt that the article you created at [[Ethan cavett]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Archer''' is a [[slab serif]] typeface designed in 2001 by [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] and [[Jonathan Hoefler]] for use in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine. It was later released by [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] for commercial licensing.

==Structure==

The typeface is a [[Slab_serif#Geometric_model|geometric]] slab serif, one with a geometric design similar to sans-serif fonts. It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. [[Ball terminal|Balls]] were added to the upper terminals on letters such as ''C'' and ''G'' to increase its charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Jonathan Hoefler|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27370.html|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italic type|Italics]] are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Typographica review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Earls|first1=David John|title=Archer|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/archer/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for [[Wells Fargo]] and is a main font for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Lauren|title=Is Archer's Use on Target?|url=http://www.aiga.org/is-archers-use-on-target/|publisher=AIGI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the [[Design Observer]] website.

The result was '''redirect''' to [[The Mikado]]. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 11:59, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
===[[Katisha]]===
Contains no information not in [[The Mikado]] article, the point of the spin-off unclear, as the character only appears in one opera, and it's unclear how this could expand further. In normal circumstances I'd say merge or make it a redirect, but, as I said, everything IS covered in [[The Mikado]], and I can't imagine someone searching for &quot;Katisha&quot;.  [[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' article per nomination.  Anything notable about this character should appear in the plot summary of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  There is no reason to have a separate article for this character.  -- [[User:Ssilvers|Ssilvers]] 19:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' it to [[The Mikado]] -- merge isn't needed since the info's there, but the redirect could be useful -- somebody could search for it. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 22:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Nonamaker]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Nonamaker|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

== Waterboarding ==

Could you post a link where somebody calls [[surfing]] [[waterboarding]]?  I can't seem to find any. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes, Waterboarding is a very common term in Hawaii, the Western US, Australia and even some former Soviet countries. Here's a link to an article where the author references this http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/03/surfing-for-peace-in-the-gaza/. Also, I found a site that references waterboarding here http://www.hawaiiansouthshore.com/shop/product.php?productid=17375. It get's confusing; I was looking for 'surfing' but we call it Waterboarding so I got to the wrong page ;-)

: Fair enough.  That source uses &quot;water boarding&quot; with a space.  I've made a change to your edit to reflect the space. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:23, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

I removed &quot;2006 is only his second full season as a team-manager. It took other team managers, such as [[Frank Williams]] many years to win a grand prix as manager.&quot;

This suggests Fry is responsible for a dramatic turnaround in the team's performance - their 2005 and 2006 performances have been widely acknowledged to have been poor to middling. the circumstances of the Hungarian GP were also exceptional. [[User:Mark83|Mark83]] 19:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been reported in the Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/5369856/Monaco-Grand-Prix-Jenson-Buttons-playboy-days-behind-him.html) that Nick Fry owns a proportion of the team, and in an earlier article, that he owns the majority stake. Shouldn't this be added?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.239.225.23|92.239.225.23]] ([[User talk:92.239.225.23|talk]]) 23:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Klein-Glienicke Schweizerhaus 1.jpg|thumb|320px|''Schweizerhaus'' in [[Klein Glienicke]] near [[Berlin]], designed by [[Ferdinand von Arnim]], 1867]]
'''Swiss chalet style''' ({{lang-de|Schweizerstil}}, {{lang-no|Sveitserstil}}) is an [[architectural style]] of [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicism]], originally inspired by rural [[chalet]]s in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] (mountainous) regions of [[Central Europe]]. The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' era.

==History==
[[File:Villa Fridheim, Krøderen, 2.jpg|thumb|Villa Fridheim in [[Krødsherad]], Norway]]
Swiss chalet style originated in the [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the [[English landscape garden]] inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]]. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the &quot;simple life&quot; of people living in the mountains. 

The chalet style soon spread over the German ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' landscapes such as the [[Harz]] mountains or the [[Dresden]] area and the adjacent [[North Bohemia]]n region. As a &quot;modern&quot; building style, it also influenced the [[resort architecture]] along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaside, like in [[Binz]] or [[Heringsdorf, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Heringsdorf]]. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like [[Heinrich von Ferstel]] to build larger mansions and hotels. 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the [[architecture of Norway]], [[architecture of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Architecture of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and in the [[country house]] architecture of [[architecture of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati (Ohio, USA)]], in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the [[Boathouse at Belton House]], [[Lincolnshire]], by [[Anthony Salvin]] and the Swiss Cottage at [[Osbourne House]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], constructed for [[Queen Victoria]]'s children.

==Characteristics==
The style is characterized by:
*[[Gabled roof|Gabled roofs]] with wide [[eaves]]
*Exposed construction beams, including large [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]
*Decorative carving and mouldings
*[[Balconies]]
*Large windows
*[[Weatherboarding]], usually painted, often in bright colors

The result was '''delete'''. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the &quot;keep&quot; comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - he's ten years old, for crying out loud. If he makes it as a pro then add him in but not until then. [[User:Qwghlm|Qwghlm]] 20:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' You can't delete or not delete an article purely based on age. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' - the point is that he doesn't meet [[WP:BIO]]. There are thousands of kids with potential; they get articles here when that potential is realised by playing for the first team of a significant club. WP is not a crystal ball. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Well, that wasn't the point that you made, but it does pass [[WP:BIO]] based on [[WP:GOOGLE]]. There is no crystal ball to this article at all, it is all based on present information and known fact. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*****'''Comment''' What &quot;known fact?&quot;  There is not a single source cited in the entire article.  I am particularly leery of this becoming another AFD where the article is kept because of references cited in the AFD discussion that never make it into the article thus defeating the entire purpose of this discussion and [[WP:V]].  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*We can, however, '''delete''' an article if no reliable sources are provided when challenged under [[WP:V|verifiability policy]].  Pinkkeith, can you point us to featured coverage in mainstream media?  Some of those are needed to let us keep the article.  Being signed to a youth team isn't notable enough to get thousands of other kids their own WP articles.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 20:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
** Here is a [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-01-maney_x.htm USA Today article] on him. In there the writer mentions that he was covered in numerous other newspapers. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*** - fine but he has achieved nothing in the adult world - the press references are the result of a splendid publicity campaign for his video but that doesn't confer notability. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**** That's blatent [[ephebiphobia]]. Reread the article, the entire article is talking about the video and how it made him notable. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Jean+Carlos+Chera%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Google News Archive] search yields 74 unique hits- more than enough to qualify as &quot;the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.&quot; How old the subject is and the method in which he was made notable isn't relevant; the subject meets [[WP:BIO]]. --[[User talk:Rory096|Rory096]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - most of the content, apart from his birthdate, fails [[WP:V]]. The Ghits mean we can keep the article not that we must. They are all the result of a single video being published on the internet and they have all picked up the same story.

[[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-So he's a child prodigy, that doesn't make him notable.  Some of my friends are amazing at basketball, but they don't have any articles.  As above, if he makes it to the pros (or college, if Brazil has a college league, I dunno), then we can always repost.

*'''Delete'''  When he has played for Manchester United, Arsenal, Porto, Eindhoven or Real Madrid he will have earned his article.  Until then it is worth remembering that, at least in the UK, it would be highly improper for professional clubs to express an interest in a 10 year old, let alone to 'openly court' them.

*'''Delete''' I've reviewed some of these news articles. I can read only the English ones, which are basically the same novelty one-shot story, repeated, or something like the USA today story, which is more about how everyone is famous on the Internet than a biographical source for an article.

*'''Delete''' as per [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Christian Maldini|Maldini's 9-years-old son]] AfD. No more notable than him, in my opinion. --[[User:Angelo.romano|Angelo]] 00:54, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - I think most of the delete (and some of the keep) votes are completely missing the point. Of course this kid isn't a notable footballer. He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at [[Mahir Çağrı]]. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for &quot;that kid i saw clips of on TV&quot; or &quot;that kid my mate sent me videos of&quot; and who's name give 35,000 google hits... He should be here! [[User:Alii h|aLii]] 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per norm. [[User:Minfo|м info]] 23:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. [[User:TerriersFan|TerriersFan]] 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause &quot;well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem&quot; let's do it. Do it and stop arguing bullshits. --[[User:Necronudist|necronudist]] 09:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.  His mom remarried and had another child, a daughter named Brittani (Gamble).</text>

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|-
|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|[[User:Robth|Robth]]

|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

That all of these articles were somehow military related was surely coincidence! :)

'''Joe Eubanks''' (born 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by the [[ring name]] '''Lobo'''. He wrestled primarily in [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the [[CZW Hall of Fame]] in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/040207.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show February 7, 2004 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - ECW Arena|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1999-2002===
Along with [[Nick Gage]], [[Justice Pain]], and [[Ric Blade]], Lobo was trained by [[John Zandig]] at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html CZWHookup : The history of CZW] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210134119/http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html |date=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second [[CZW Iron Man Championship|Iron Man Champion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt; He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/990619.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Down in Flames June 19, 1999 - Mantua, NJ |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first ''Cage of Death'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/991016.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death October 16, 1999 - Mantua, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to [[Matt Prince|Wifebeater]], but regain it one more time the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000311.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW March Violence March 11, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobo also challenged for the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship|CZW Heavyweight Championship]]. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until ''Cage of Death II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000909.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death II....After Dark September 9, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;  After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until ''Cage of Death IV'' when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/021213.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling December 13, 2002 - Philadelphia, PA - Viking Hall|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003-present===
He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at ''Cage of Death V'', but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At ''Night of Infamy II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031115.html|title=Night of Infamy II - November 15, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031213.html|title=Cage of Death V December 13, 2003 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;

At [[Cage of Death 7]], [[Zandig]], who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with [[Justice Pain]] and [[Nick Gage]]. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/|title=2006 results

*'''Speedy Delete''' - for blatant advertising.  I waited a bit to see how this one would play out before making a decision, but as much good faith as I normally assume, there is no sticking up for this one.  The article's [[User:Kobius|prime editor]] (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page.  The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts.  Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion.

The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I.

==BBC News Report and the pilot &quot;looking for a good place to crash&quot;==

The BBC article states that the pilot was looking for a good place to put the aircraft down; he missed some park and instead put the aircraft down in an uninhabited area near Stockport city centre. The evidence does not justify this supposition whatsoever. For one thing, the AIB report states that the aircraft was likely uncontrollable after the engines cut out, and might not have been controllable even before then. The first officer died and the captain suffered retrograde amnesia, so we don't know what went on in the cockpit. There isn't the tiniest shred of evidence that the pilot &quot;put the aircraft down&quot; someplace safe. It was likely just coincidence - there are a lot of empty or disused areas around airports and under approach paths (and *that* is often deliberate).

This is such a common urban legend/media foofah. Every time a plane doesn't actually fall out of the sky, some media type comes up and says the pilot was &quot;looking for a place to crash that wouldn't cause injuries on the ground&quot;. I don't blame the Wikipedian who put this in at all, because he/she likely didn't have any sources other than the BBC article. I am blaming the BBC for making a supposition not supported by the facts.

I suppose people want to think that in an emergency the first thing the pilot will do is look for a safe place to crash. It makes them feel less worried about an aircraft crashing into their home, school, or place of business. It ain't necessarily so, though; in fact it almost is never so. Aircraft about to crash are more often than not uncontrollable - that's why they crash. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Edited to add: The cause of the accident wasn't &quot;pump failure&quot; (boo, BBC, again). It was a design error in the fuel line. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Apologies. That would have been my factual faux pas. Thank you for correcting my blathering and making this article respectable. :) [[User:Legion89|Legion]] 13:56, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

A second's more flight and the plane would catastrophically have taken the tower off Stockport's fine Town Hall and crashed into the facade of the (then) infirmary opposite the Town Hall, blocking the main road between that runs from Manchester through Stockport to the south - AG, Stockport.

== Additional cause of this crash ==

I remember seeing a BBC program about this crash. It reported on the findings of the inquiry. It said that there was an additional reason for the crash.

Apparently, the engine speeds were shown in the cockpit on two dials, one for each wing. Each dial had two hands, one for each engine and each labelled with the engine number.

This had been serviced, and a mistake had been made so that engine 3 was connected to the hand marked &quot;4&quot;, and engine 4 to hand &quot;3&quot;.

I think it was engine 4 that was starved of fuel. The pilot saw from the dial that engine 3 had stopped, so he switched off / feathered engine 3. Now both engines on the right wing were out. (This would explain why engine 4 was windmilling.)

As part of the investigation, they tried flying a similar aircraft with engines 3 and 4 both out, and discovered that the aircraft could not be flown properly.

Now, I mention all this because it is an interesting story. Also, because I want to apply the moral to setting up a computer cluster. I want to avoid the possibility of one computer failing and a different one being taken out for service by mistake, thereby bringing down the cluster. 

Does anyone know more about this? [[User:Mm67|Mm67]] 11:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]] a consensus guideline?==
Please state your position, '''yes''' or '''no''', explain your position and defend it.  This is not a vote.  [[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 10:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I consider it one, and I'm not sure what objection people have - if there's a problem that needs fixing, let's fix it.  I already refer to it, guideline or not, since it's very useful.  --[[User:Minderbinder|Minderbinder]] 12:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' Not only is it a consensus guideline, it is absolutely vital for Wikipedia to have such a guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 12:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I certainly support this guideline, what it is trying to do, and how it is trying to achieve it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' We're ready to go into the stage where changes should be discussed here before being implemented in the policy page. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' We've numerous AfDs and arbcom cases which have documented that this is the community's intent. --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 17:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* I don't see where the proposed criteria add meaningful advice to writters or evaluators, and the preamble/text is way too long to be practical.  Please cite some examples of AfD where this proposal would have ensured an outcome other than what would have been achieved under the current guidelines.  For each of the criteria now listed I belive that proper application of WP:N and WP:ATT would acheive the same results.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 17:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
** There is [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], where this standard helped to refine the arguments that finally got the topic removed.  The aupporters trying to use this guideline to buoy their cause ended up only showing all the more that the article did not belong in Wikipedia.  &lt;br&gt;You are correct that in the end articles that are removed will be so removed (or not) due to policy concerns.  The need for this guideline comes from its ability to focus the debate on the issues that are important in the relevant cases.  In other words, it helps to achieve the &quot;proper application&quot; that you are claiming makes this guideline irrelevant. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** EMS, could your purpose be acheived with an essay?  Among the problems with permutations from guidelines and policies is the evolution into redundant and conficting guidance to the point that writers and evaluators become confused and the branches work at cross purposes.  My frequent analogy is the US Tax Code, which has bread several large industries for interpretation and application.  Writing complex rule sets requires great skill and caution. --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** On review of the Electric universe (concept) AfD, it appears to be resoundingly rejected with the tools we already have, most convincingly original research and few reliable sources.  This outcome is consistent with other scientific and academic issues which I have seen defeated at AfD. An excellent nomination doesn't hurt either! --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**** Right now I am wondering what your agenda is here, as this type of opposition usually comes from someone who has lost an AfD in part due to this and the guidelines and is seeking to water down the standards.  One of the factors that helped with the electric universe AfD was the the nominator was also working on this guideline and used its insights in writing the nom.  Beyond that, there is the basic issue of moving beyond &quot;peer review&quot; as a standard for inclusion, a test passed by numerous non-notable articles that I have seen.  Also, I at least have gone to some pains to couch this as a setting standard for inclusions instead of exclusion.  That way, an argument that &quot;X calls for inclusion&quot; renders this guideline moot as a refutation, and so avoids the types of conflicts that in our laws make being a lawyer such a profitable profession. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
***** My agenda is not as you assert, but your question is a fair one, which I will answer.  My agenda is clarity in the grand scheme of notability guidelines, without a specific prejudice to this proposal. Please visit the discussion page for WP:N to see that there are many people expressing concerns over the whole process.  I support the concept of &quot;encyclopedic suitability&quot;, which we call notablility at WP, for lack of a better name.  I also consider myself a moderate inclusionist.  I am a frequent participant in Afd.  You are correct in one respect, that I origninally became involved in AfD and notability, because I saw too many abuses by uninformed editors who were deleting meanigful articles, though not specifically in the field of science.  My interest is in history and sailing.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC) 
******Might I recommend that your &quot;no&quot; comment seems to be motivated more by a general dislike for [[WP:N]] rather than a specific distaste for this particular guideline. In particular, the motivation behind this guideline was in part due to a charge made during the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience arbitrartion case]] that such a guideline should exist to fend off charges related to whether an idea was notable in a scientific sense. One can argue whether [[WP:N]] should exist or not, but that's not for us to decide here. It is absolutely not true that this guideline is redudant: there is no other place where it is indicated what makes a scientific idea notable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. [[WP:NOR]] doesn't help because &quot;originality&quot; is a vague concept related to heavily to [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COI]] to be useful when people just make random articles about ostensibly scientific subjects they read about online, for example. [[WP:A]] doesn't help because there are scientific ideas which are not notable (the general consensus of the community is that they do not belong in the encyclopedia) which nevertheless are attributable to reliable sources. [[WP:NPOV]] doesn't work because the exclusion criteria at [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] is unable to distinguish between majority and minority except by [[WP:CON|consensus]]. That's why this guideline is needed and why it is used. Look at all the pages that link here and tell me that it isn't referred to. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* No, it's not.  I think the burden of some evidence that this guideline is widely supported and necessary needs to be shown from the supporters.  Right now it's an initiative, a proposal with stable wording.  However, even in the &quot;test cases&quot; that I looked at, it seems that this guideline isn't being referred to, and evaluation of the articles in question isn't done with these guidelines in mind, rather, articles are mainly evaluated from a point of view of adequate sourcing and original research issues, in other words, policies we already have.  (I do think the editors here have reached a reasonably stable consensus, though.  But that doesn't, to me, make a &quot;consensus guideline,&quot; which implies support from the community overall.)[[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**The evidence is in the ''What links here'' tool you can access from the toolbox. I think that you may have a hidden agenda here: you tend to be a bit too quick to agree to a supression bias against non-experts in the fields of science. Is this a misplaced concern? --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
***First of all there are over 150 things that link to [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]], so it's not unreasonable to expect evidence to be actually gathered by someone trying to make a case.  But more, I went to a few of those &quot;what links here&quot; and apparently the only reason they were linked was that trialsanderrors mentioned that the debate was a test case: not people actually referring to the guideline and trying to use it.  Look at the Electric Universe AfD, for instance, which is the best example I've seen of a borderline-notable scientific theory (where this guideline might help).  [[WP:SCIENCE]] was not used as an argument in the debate, even by you, and the arguments that led to it being deleted were not even much along the lines of what is presented here in the guideline, but were according to core Wikipedia policies like [[WP:ATT]], [[WP:OR]] and so on.  Some of the argument is covered here in the introduction, but the &quot;criteria&quot; part played no role and seems to be central to this as a notability guideline.  So, this is what I mean when I say that no evidence has been presented.  What do YOU mean when you say this is a consensus guideline?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****The criteria part played a huge role. The only criteria that EU could have come close to satisfying was recognition in popular culture/outside media and we showed that it was not notable along those lines. The guidelines at the time were being formulated and weren't as clear as they are now, but thanks to discussions such as that AfD we have a clearer demarcation. I think you need to read through the AfD we reference again and look carefully at how the criteria line-up with the criteria outlined in this guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*****Could you show me precisely where?  I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't see it.  I see your point #5 in the nomination, but that sounds like the core [[WP:N]] argument, and not related to the criteria here.  And anyway, saying the the EU debate influenced [[WP:SCIENCE]] kind of precludes that the EU debate can be thought of as evidence that this is a consensus guideline.  Can you show me ANY AfD debate that explicitly references the criteria?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
******Number 5 in the nomination. While it doesn't explicitly reference this page, it does so implicitly (and if I recall correctly at the time the standards were still being developed as to which criteria were going to be grouped with which). --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*******Again, #5 was really along the lines of basic [[WP:N]].  Again, show me any debates that explicitly reference the criteria.  There's a difference between this proposal being wise or balanced or sensible and it having ''broad community support.''  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
********Basic [[WP:N]]&quot;? That's a bit of WikiLawyering I haven't come across before. The fact is that #5 has direct parallels to our criteria here. You can thrust your head in the sand over this all you want, but that's the plain truth of the matter. And now you reposition your attack to claim that there isn't &quot;broad community support&quot;, but let me remind you that arbcomm members entreatied the community to develop these standards in the first place and that by virtue of this being a Wiki it will end up as balanced and sensible as possible. I'm beginning to think you are being a stick-in-the-mud for reasons you aren't coming clean about. Help me out, explain to me why you always seem to be fighting against scientific accuracy at Wikipedia so I can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] towards your contributions. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***I suggest you go read [[WP:AGF]] and actually take it to heart.  In our current discussion, you seem to have trouble differentiating between (1) my personal support or opposition of the proposal and (2) my arguing that the proposal isn't a &quot;consensus guideline&quot;, that is, that it doesn't have broad support.  This wouldn't be a very hard difference to understand if you had been assuming good faith of me in the first place.  For the record, I support some of what the proposal says but not all of it, but that wasn't the basis for my objections: calling the proposal a &quot;consensus guideline&quot; is wrong, because this is still a very new proposal, barely even stable enough to judge.  [[WP:PROF]] remained a proposal for a very long time, and finally became a guideline when it became apparent that the guideline had influenced the way decisions were being made, and that the community, de facto, embraced the guideline.  Creation of policies and guidelines is slow and for good reason, especially when actionable changes are being proposed (like the criteria here).

****I appreciate your candor regarding your opinions of the content of this guideline because that is precisely what concerns me. However, I do feel that you are being a bit oblique in your commentary. &quot;Policy creation is slow,&quot; is often the cry of those who want to slow things down, and people tend to drag their feet for a reason. To me and many of the other editors who commented above, this guideline is ''de facto'' in place and isn't a proposal because we as editors abide by it. As you know, Wikipedia policies and guidelines are not written to affect change in the encyclopedia, but rather are meant to describe what actively goes on in editing. A good number of those who say that this is a consensus guideline edit a lot of science-related articles and so should be the ones to tell whether or not this guideline applies. I don't see that you are actively doing this as such. I do see you stepping into disputes regarding science-related articles often, and there are many times I see these actions as being in something of a contravention of the guidelines outlined here. I am being very up-front about my distrust of your motivations, but in so doing I'm also trying to assume good-faith as much as I can. Part of assuming good-faith is being transparent about one's perceptions and I'm offering you the opportunity to explain yourself as transparently as possible so we can move on. I don't like being lectured about [[WP:AGF]] when I was the one who brought it up, it looks to me like you are asking me to turn a blind eye towards our long history here at the encyclopedia and I am honestly telling you I'm having a hard time doing it because of the nature of this particular dispute we're having. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*****You are making false implications about me, and I want it to stop.  [[WP:CIV|Comment on my comments]].  You say this is an attempt to document how Wikipedia works?  I respectfully disagree -- this talk page and its archives are full of debates about what the criteria ''should'' be, with very little discussion or analysis of how things are actually decided now.  (Some, but not much.)  From perusing the test cases, it seems to me that people are nearly exclusively deciding on these cases on the basis of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:NPOV]], (and to a degree, [[WP:N]]), without much need for arguments specific to issue that the topics under discussion are scientific ones.  Since that ''isn't'' the content of this proposal, I cannot agree that this is documenting current Wikipedia practice, but if you want to try to change my mind, please show me specific examples so we can discuss them.  In any case, you should advertise this debate on [[WP:VPR]]; the general Wikipedia community should have a chance to comment.

******Whether they are false or not, they are simply my questions regarding your, frankly, obstinate resistance to this particular document. I am trying to be as forthright as possible here, and your increasingly haughty responses only confuse me further since you still haven't addressed directly my concerns regarding the history we have surrounding issues such as this. I disagree that the discussions are centering around how things &quot;should&quot; be. Rather I see discussions centering around generalizing from the experience that editors have. You also seem to be under the opinion that just because people reference older and more established policies and guidelines they aren't also considering this guideline. This I find to be particularly problematic because it ignores the words of people that aren't appended with a WP-acronym. Just because somebody doesn't cite this directly doesn't mean that you can't see the criteria being applied (as per our earlier discussion on EU deletion). I would hope that you would look more closely at the deletion discussions surrounding this and see if you can't spot the criteria in action. I am not going to advertise the debate anywhere, but you are free to do so. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*******I've advertised the debate at [[WP:VPR]].  In terms of the status: you see one thing, I see another thing.  I'm not going to change my opinion by simply being told &quot;please look more closely,&quot; although you could convince me if you actually showed me some evidence.  I do see a lot of attempts at guiding the community: take a look at [[#&quot;Conference topic&quot; is a backdoor]], for instance, or [[#One final thought]]: people are discussing how to make a good rule, not what the rule is, organically.

********I do think that you are seriously misinterpreting the conversations we've had here.

***That's taking a rather biased and authoritarian position on subcommunities of Wikipedia. I, for one, don't care if WP:N is trashed: what's relevant to science articles is this set of guidelines.

****I'm with SA here: [[WP:N]] is being criticized partly because of its extreme generality.  No reason to think the entire idea of notability for all topics must pause just because of that.

****  The problem lies less with any individual sub-guideline, but more with a plethora of permutations leading to confusion.  As sub categories go this may be among the better candidates, but there shoould be efforts at coordination among the various efforts.  Collectively, many well intentioned efforts can create bedlam.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:10, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***** I don't see any bedlam here.  I see this as being a well crafted guideline that is dealing with issues which are out-of-scope for the more general guideline due to its broad nature.  This guideline deals with the issues of science and science-related topics, and how to implement the notability guidelines within that context.&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the [[WP:N]] discussion and I get the feeling that you are doing your best to create uncertainty and confusion there.  And now you are trying to do the same here.  I for one have no need for it, and support this guideline as a reflection of the legitimate sense of the science editors here as to what is valid. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*Yes, this appears to be a consensus guideline. The opposition to this guideline proposal may be part of a campaign in which User:Kevin Murray in the past month has placed &quot;rejected&quot; , &quot;disputed&quot; , or &quot;historical&quot; , or &quot;essay&quot; labels on about a dozen notability proposals or guidelines or has nominated them for deletion on the grounds that there was no consensus or that they constituted &quot;instruction creep&quot; or were redundant. A proposal is not necessarily impossible to reach consensus upon just because a few editors oppose it.

** I see your point.  This editor really, really has a grudge against the concept of notability, and I would love to know why.  If you want to do a [[WP:RfC]] against him, I am will be happy to second it.  This is ridiculous. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*** No EMS, this editor, has a &quot;grudge&quot; against needless and redundant rule making for the sake of rule making.  I strongly support the concept of encyclopedic suitability which we call &quot;notability&quot; at WP.  This is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; but based on observations from life experience, that too many conficting rules create confusion rather than clarity.  Complex rule-sets require incredible cross coordination among the permutations, which is not happening here at WP, as guidelines are multiplying like rabbits without consideration of the big picture.  If you propose an RfC, please do so in the best interest of WP, not &quot;against&quot; me; this is not personal and reviewing the discussions will reveal that my actions are well supported.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 14:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
****There are plenty of Wikipedians who [[WP:IAR|agree with you about hating rules]]. However, might I suggest that you are going about it the wrong way. We are here writing this guideline because we need to summarize what has been done in regards to this issue. Your own personal distaste for the way in which editors have gone about doing this is probably best argued elsewhere: it certainly has nothing to do with whether consensus exists for this particular guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*** I do not see '''any''' need to coordinate this guideline with any other guidelines beside [[WP:N]] itself.  Although I am doing my own &quot;[[WP:NOR|original research]]&quot;, I have seem enough -uh- &quot;stuff&quot; offered by others such that I see a need to draw a firm and reasonable as to what is and is not acceptable here.  Until it has some reasonable amount of recognition in the scientific community, I see an article on my ideas as being an abuse of Wikipedia.  Yet I am unusual in that most other editors of Wikipedia with alternate ideas are here to promote those ideas, and they hate guidelines like this one with a purple passion because they help to keep their OR out.&lt;br&gt;BTW - I do see where you have had some success with you anti-Notability campaign.  Personally I think that you are doing Wikipedia a real disservice with it, and what you are stifling is not a bunch useless rule-making but instead needed elaborations on the meaning of Notability in various domains.  As has been noted in [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability|the WP:N discussion]], there is a level of subjectiveness in determining notability.  The need for these subsidary guidelines is to limit that subjectiveness, and thereby make this concept more usable.  Instead you are trying to pull the rug out from under Notability, something that will make the removal of questionable material much more difficult than it should be. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''the real test''' is whether the guidelines here will be accepted in practice. Both the above positions are to some degree correct: the guideline should reflect what its eds. believe to be the common feeling of the community, but it shouldalso point in the direction of where the consensus appears to be moving, and to be making recommendations from those most involved in edited these articles to guide thos less familiar. I think it will prove to be accepted because it is relatively straightforward, not complex -- at least by comparison -- and, in my view it does reflect the general voice. But we shall see. 
::The real dispute , I think, is over the notability of fringe science and whether that can be considered science in any sense at all. This is a matter in which I think there is in fact no real consensus, but at best a temporary majority, and i expect this  question to continue to be the theme of AfDs. I don't think this guideline  lays it to rest '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 23:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::: This guideline cannot and should not judge whether something is &quot;real science&quot;.  In fact, all that a determination that something is &quot;not science&quot; can do here is to remove a topic from being judged by this criteria with no resolution on its notability or lack thereof.  IMO, we have a set of criteria here such that anything that is meant to be judged as part of science can be ruled on here, be it mainstream or fringe.  What I think that you will find is that the least palatable topics are those which also have had the least impact and are also therefore the least notable.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

== Some suggestions on organizing this project page ==

* The introduction is too long.  Limit it to &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.  Get the commentary (i.e. &quot;impetus&quot;) and discussion of process into its own section.  Specifically address what makes ''science'' different from other areas covered by the general guidelines.
* Criteria should define at least these categories as guidance to editors:
** topics which on their face should be include (i.e. the notable)
** topics which are going to require some judgments to be made by editors if they are new articles or added to existing articles. (i.e. the maybe notable)
** topics which, at least according to the authors of the guideline, are ''improbably'' included. (i.e. nonnotable)
* The statement ''&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;'' is bizarre because the opinion of Wikipedia editors is what, by definition, compose the Wikipedia. ''&quot;Must always&quot;'' is a rather strange term to be found in a mere ''guideline'' at any rate. [[User:Patsw|patsw]] 13:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:: If you wish to draft an alternate version, the feel free to do so ''elsewhere'' and present it to us as a possible replacement.  We are certainly amenable to productive changes.  However, IMO the current project page works and should be considered a functioning guideline. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:I agree the ''reflect outside authorities'' wording is odd (although not any odder than &quot;notability is not subjective&quot; which expresses the [[WP:ATT|same sentiment]]). The rest doesn't strike me as an improvement. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::One point that isn't being made (in the intro) and probably should be is the point that scientific theories cannot be properly presented without understanding their level of acceptance.  There's a big difference between a mainstream theory and a fringe theory, and even in an article about a fringe theory, it's important to describe it as one.  However, for some fringe theories, insufficient sources exist to back up the claim that they are fringe theories.  Thus we are left with only one real choice: disallow the article, as we cannot properly cover it while adhering to [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:NPOV]].  This is different from, say, an article about a band, where it may be that no source reports on their popularity or number of fans accurately, but sources do report on other things: the information we can't cover can just be left out.  In articles on science, we really can't leave that out.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The &quot;level of acceptance&quot; argument makes no sense to me. &quot;Theory&quot; in science has a very precise meaning which applies to models and descriptions which are as completely accepted as possible in an endeavor based primarily on the dubious activity of inductive reasoning. While there is a big difference between mainstream and fringe proposals, the proposals themselves are only considered &quot;theories&quot; when they pass the tests of the scientific method. What makes a proposal fringe is, ostensibly, its inability to pass these tests. This doesn't mean that scientists don't make mistakes in pejoratively labeling the fringe out of the mainstream, only to say that the level of acceptance is something of a binary operator: either it's in or it's out. When an idea does not generate enough interest in the scientific community to create commentary from members of the community, it must either be uncontroversial (as is the case with textbook knowledge) or it must be outside the scientific community. This is quite easy to verify. No amount of posturing and insisting on the part of a fringe idea's proponents that the idea is actually &quot;scientific&quot; is good enough when demarcating for our purposes. We might still have articles on the idea if there is &quot;extra-scientific&quot; interest in it, but we do not need to shy away from being honest about its &quot;extra-scientific&quot; nature. One of the problems that many pro-fringe editors have is that they believe that because [[negative proof|proving the negative]] is in principle a defiance of [[WP:ATT]] that reasonable editors can't make editorial judgments with regards to the status of a particular idea. This is simply not the case at all: we are editing an encyclopedia not compiling a list of sources. After all, that's why we have editors in the first place: we are charged with summarizing the available data in the most conformist way possible. When all the data is outside the scientific community and the idea purports to have scientific importance, it is perfectly fine to delineate the contradiction. However, this discussion is probably better suited for [[WP:FRINGE]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

*I think it is a little more complicated than that.
*It is not ''necessary'' to give an indication of the acceptance of a theory, in order to describe it.
*And I don't think the word &quot;theory&quot; has such a precise meaning as scientists would like. For example, Wikipedia calls the [[Big Bang]] a &quot;theory&quot;, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannic calls it a &quot;Model&quot;. And I am sure there are more sources supporting both.
*This is why the new [[WP:A]] is so important. I can attribute both the Big Bang Theory, and the Big Bang Model, but I can find no source which agues it must be one or the other.
*I can also find no attribution labelling many minority subjects as &quot;fringe&quot;, nor claiming a certain level of acceptance. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Making this an approved guideline ==

I notice that Kevin Murray has downgraded this guideline back to the &quot;proposed&quot; status.  I would revert that myself, except that I am not at all clear by what action/authority it became considered a functioning guideline.  Certainly the above poll has produced only five people who support this as a guideline.  Even without the two nay-sayers I fail to see how the five of us constitute a group that can speak for the Wikipedia community as a whole, or at least the science editors.

I for one do call for the issue of approving this as a functioning guideline be presented to the community as a whole.  [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|the Village Pump policy forum]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Science|WikiProject Science]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics|WikiProject Physics]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry|WikiProject Chemistry]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biology|WikiProject Biology]] are all places where this guideline can be advertised and input and approval sought.  I see little danger in this and much promise, but mostly I would like to be able to show Kevin a formal approval so that is downgrading of this guideline cannot occur again. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::We don't do &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;official&quot; with respect to guidelines. What matters is if this is (1) a good idea and (2) used as such in practice. AFD is a consensus-building process, so if this page matches what happens on AFD then it matches consensus. Judged by this talk page and AFD, the answer to all three is 'yes', so this page is a de facto guideline and Kevin is the lone dissenter here. Of course, putting a notice on the village pump never hurts.

:::Kevin is not the only dissenter, I also am.  Let me enumerate some general criticisms, this time relating to the substance of the proposal.  1.  There is not a big need for this.  Most science articles up for deletion are up for other concerns than notability, primarily, concerns that the article is original research, POV, or inadequately sourced.  Although there are many debates on the test pages subpage, in very few was the critical issue the notability of the subject: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Socionomics]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Growing Earth Theory]] (and the old debates, not listed there, about [[Time Cube]]).  2.  The list of criteria, a core part of this proposal, were not used as the basis of successful arguments in any of the key examples I listed.  Rather, the test seems to be the general one of being covered in multiple independent sources, inside or outside of the scientific community.  Note that the criteria give an opportunity to supporters of OR articles (real OR, not neutral attempts at describing published research) to argue for inclusion inappropriately: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as an example of this.  The criteria have changed since then, but the same kind of argument could be made today.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize any of those debates by having a guideline here with such minimal applicability.  3.  The list of criteria is instruction creep and isn't useful.  For articles that should be deleted, not meeting the criteria doesn't make a strong argument.  For articles that should be kept, they're okay, but arguments to delete things that meet these criteria are weak delete arguments in the first place, usually along the lines of &quot;this article is in bad shape&quot;, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ubiquitous computing]] for example.  The criteria seem aimed at solving a non-existant problem of the over-deletion of notable science topics.

*The fundamental flaw of [[WP:SCIENCE|Notability (science)]], is that it tries to determine only whether an article is '''scientifically''' notable. It does not consider whether an article may be notable in '''any''' other area.

*: This is a true red herring IMO.  A failure of scientific notability does not mean that an article may have notability in another manner and therefore be worthy of inclusion.  I did have wording here to that effect at one time, but it seems to have been lost.  I will see to restoring that, as I see this guideline as being usable only as a means of inclusion.  For the purposes of exclusion, the failure of a topic to merit inclusion under any guideline (including this one) is the relevant matter. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
*:  (Edit conflict) Agree with EMS; The page clearly embraces the idea that popular notability for science topics is appropriate.  Since popular notability definitely is acceptable (see the [[Time Cube]] precedent, for instance), any wording that implies otherwise should be examined.  But you aren't correctly representing the main thrust of the proposal.

==One researcher POV fails NPOV==
*The third paragraph includes an incorrect statement:

*This is a complete misunderstanding of [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. If we attribute a statement to a single researcher, and it conforms to [[WP:A]] and is not misrepresented, then it conforms to NPOV. The argument is whether a statement by a single researchers is ''notable'', which is completely different. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::*Describing the POV of one person does not automatically fail NPOV, and any decent editor can describe any POV in way that fulfils NPOV.

:::::::What you fail to realize is that there is an informal community discussion as well as a formal publication discussion. Those who are in a particular community are aware of the informal discussion and are able to tell when a topic is ignored/scoffed or when it is accepted. This cannot be reported at Wikipedia for verifiability reasons, but it still raises NPOV concerns when certain editors try to force obscure research into the forefront of an article. You are mistaking a standard of verifiability (which is the standard for how to write an article) with editorial judgement: they need not be one-in-the-same. In other words, one need not &quot;verify&quot; that there is NPOV issues because, as editors, our editorial opinions do not need to be (nor can they be) verified. The only thing that needs to be verifiable is the text of the article. We are allowed to have judgements that are external to this. As such, it is perfectly reasonable to say that there are NPOV problems with someone citing a single, isolated, though published research paper. In terms of your dark matter red herring, you have totally misconstrued the situation, and I'm fairly confident that nearly any third party not firmly ensconced in pathological skepticism toward mainstream astrophysics would find your evaluation predictably myopic. Clowe's triumphalist attitude is only justified from the standpoint of [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]. It's not like he was publishing his &quot;proof&quot; of dark matter in a vacuum -- it was a particular point that was addressed to a particular (MOND-type) objection. However, when your hypothetical John Doe bucks the established research by publishing proof against dark matter, he is publishing in a vacuum. Prof. John Doe's work is marginal and therefore marginalized by Wikipedia. Clowe's work is mainstream and therefore reported by Wikipedia. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::SA is quite right about verifiability vs. editorial judgement.  However, I have to say I worry when editorial judgement of this type comes into dispute.  Wikipedia needs sources for two reasons: one is to have attributions in the articles, but another reason is that it levels the playing field in editorial discussions.  Inherently, experts on Wikipedia are not set above ordinary editors, but they may be more familiar with the subject in question.  But experts have to prove themselves, just like anyone else.  Fundamentally, Wikipedia is a community of equal editors.  So, this is a good argument ''for'' [[WP:SCIENCE]]: in order to avoid having to rely on editorial judgement too heavily, we look for a higher standard of quality in sources for scientific topics, and where that doesn't exist, we should avoid covering the subject.

:::::::::*Let's not mix up NPOV and editorial judgment. As I said earlier, the statement in the introduction is incorrect concerning NPOV. I also said it may concern notability, so I'm not dismissing the point. But let's be accurate as editors.
:::::::::*The idea that a community has informal discussions which a particular editor may be aware, is worthless. It is not verifiable, nor attributable. 
:::::::::*I know THREE different communities, all of whom have informal discussions, and promise peer reviewed papers that I could mention too. Also worthless.
:::::::::*An encyclopedia does not run on material gleaned from Chinese whispers via anonymous, unaccountable editors.
:::::::::*I had previously brought this up at the Neutrality Project, see &quot;[[Wikipedia_talk:Neutrality_Project#NPOV_misunderstanding|NPOV misunderstanding]]&quot;. They agree. A singular POV can be described in an NPOV manner. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 16:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

NPOV is inherently based in editorial judgement. The only way that someone determines whether there is a problem with NPOV is by making an editorial judgement. That's why the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{POV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag comes with the wording it does. Disputes arise between editors over NPOV: if there was a singular editor there would never be NPOV issues from the standpoint of writing an article. While I agree with Mangojuice that editors are judged external to their status as &quot;experts&quot; (see ongoing conflicts over [[WP:EXPERT]] for example), the community doesn't deny the existence of experts either. No one is saying that the encyclopedia should be &quot;run&quot; on expert judgement or the whispers of whatever anonymous and unaccountable ethnic group, but people are saying that editors may come to the table with these concerns. That's the essence of the NPOV guideline: all the points-of-view are placed on the table and the marginalization happens per the outside community and references to the outside world. No one is saying that a singular POV cannot be described, but people are saying that singular POVs present unique difficulties when writing an encyclopedia that is supposed to be NPOV. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Indeed, all the POVs are placed on the table. And if there is just one POV (because there is one WP:V/WP:RS/WP:A), then we can still write that POV so that it conforms to NPOV, regardless of whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the POV, and regardless of whether it is mainstream of pseudoscience.
:*In which case, the statement in the third paragraph that I described above, is incorrect. A view from a single researcher may fail a criteria, but there is no reason for it to fail NPOV; and if it does, any decent editor can re-write it so that it conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:::If there is only one notable POV, then sure, we write about it. In which case the statement in the third paragraph is correct. A view from a single research written about on Wikipedia does have editorial issues related to NPOV for the reasons delineated because the alternatives may exist but cannot be included without falling into original research. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 19:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::*The statement is incorrect because a single POV does not fail NPOV unless it is written badly, in which case any competent editor can correct it. Sure, the statement may be allowed because it is notable. But it won't fail because of NPOV.
::::*A single POV that has been published elsewhere does not not fail &quot;Original research&quot;, because [[WP:NOR]] &quot;refers to '''unpublished''' facts&quot;. (my emphasis) --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

You are missing the point. Perhaps I should post here the statement that you dispute:

:''Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutrality]], in particular the section on [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]].''

You'll note that the point being made is that simply quoting published work is not good enough. Why isn't it good enough? Because unless the work in question has generated discussion it has not been vetted outside of Wikipedia to make it possible to write an article on the subject that adheres to the spirit and letter of NPOV.
--[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 20:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::The POV of a single researcher in a single first-rate peer-reviewed publication, has normally been assessed by 2 or usually 3 independent scientists with a tendency to be ciritical. The assumption made by colleagues it that such results are correct unless proven otherwise. Are we supposed to be more critical of physics that he physicists who review for PRL? Then, if discussed by independent sources, as most scientific papers are, it is considered worth citing and commenting one. Reputable journals expect items listed as references to be relevant to the new work also. I'm a librarian. i think many articles in most library journals are basically trivial if not junk altogether..

:A single POV may fail, or being accepted by some other criteria. But a single POV does not fail NPOV (unless an editor writes poorly). 
:*To suggest that a statement based on a single POV, changes it's NPOV standing, depending on some other ''potential'' discussion whose view is yet to be determined, is illogical. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 20:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

If your point is that someone can attribute a single point of view in a fashion that is NPOV, that is absolutely correct. However, not every attributable point can be written about in a neutral fashion. An example of a quote that may be non-neutral though properly attributed and sourced is given at [[WP:FRINGE#Sourcing and attribution]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Since describing a single POV can be achieved in an NPOV fashion, then the description in the third paragraph is incorrect which says that a single POV without response fails NPOV.
:*Judging/assessing a single POV is another matter altogether. But just because there may be no attributable assessments, does not make the description of a single POV automatically fail NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

I do not agree with the demand that not only must something be said in a respected peer reviewed journal, but that we must wait for other independent researchers to chime in, in OTHER respected peer reviewed journals, and agree with the first researcher that the claim is valid. The first post would constitute a reliable source satisfying [[WP:ATT]] and would be usable in a Wikipedia article. Similarly a book from a respected publisher would constitute a reliable source, without waiting for some other authority to write another book that says &quot;I agree with the first book.&quot; The demand places the bar way too high. It may be years before someone completely independent of the first researcher publishes the demanded blessing of the first researcher's claim. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

==[[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]==
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert. But these concerns and quick scans of google books and google scholar led me to bring this issue to wiser heads. Thanks very much  for checking this out.

********Good: a direct response.  Two brief points: (1) Arbcom never asked for criteria, but they did encourage developing a guideline, which is different.  (2) The EU deletion debate looks very different to me - there, the argument was done from first principles and it worked very nicely, and it skirted around the edge of these criteria (no one ever talked about whether the EU concept was &quot;textbook science&quot; or had institutional support)... and as for extended discussions with Iantresman... I don't think the criteria will make one bit of difference, and that's not a very good reason anyway.  Long-winded debate... I don't think we should seek to avoid it as a general principle, debate is a good thing.  Criteria would simplify the job but scientific topics aren't exactly overwhelming the AfD lists.  Anyway, as I said before, criteria would do better at simplifying the job if they were negative criteria instead of positive ones.

== General notability guideline template ==
Since the general notability guideline is central to most sub-pages, someone came up with the idea of creating a centralized template which will be consistent among the permutations from WP:N.  Please see whether we can make this work here.  The text is meant to be fairly generic, but it may make sense to add text following the template for fine tuning, or help us to make the template more applicable if it is not reflecting the consensus for notability.  I certainly didn't get everything that I wanted, but I'm very happy to see the compromises that make this a fairly representive of the attitude of the project.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 01:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

What are the thoughts on merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]] into this guideline proposal?  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:15, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

I've added a brief section which is the meat from the numbers guideline.  This seems appropriately and neatly combined here.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:29, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

== Scope creep ==

I may be beating a dead horse here, but all the references to NPOV, proponents and advocacy make it seem like this is about pseudoscience/fringe science, and the discussion above seems to confirm it. As it tries to apply to specialised but uncontroversial science, not much of it bears any resemblance to reality. --[[User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri|Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri]] 02:29, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal concerns (LV) ==
Note that I came here from a couple of AfDs which were trying to present this as policy criteria for an article's deleltion.  As I read down the line, I encountered several problems with the proposed guideline.  I apologize if any and all of the below have been covered in the Talk Archives, which I am not going to read now.

Problems that I have at present with the proposal:

*Introduction:
:* &quot;A topic that is acceptable under this guideline is an appropriate part of Wikipedia.&quot;
::Pretty sweeping blanket statement, to me.  No other Notability criteria I'm aware of suggests that &quot;if it passes this, it's in.&quot;  Indeed, it seems to violate the principle of a Guideline to me, which always limits itself to allow potential exceptions.  Further, each section usually defines which criteria are primary and which are secondary.
*Notability of topics related to science:
:*&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;
::I know this has been mentioned above, but I want to echo this concern:  Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the consensus of the Wikipedia editors.  Anything else beyond that is helpful clarification, or it becomes fodder for people to [[WP:IAR]].
::I'd feel much more comfortable with something like, ''&quot;Deicions about including or excluding material on a scientific basis ought to be supported by the opinions and stated facts of outside authorities, as per [[WP:RS|Wikpedia:Reliable Sources]].&quot;''  Start throwing 'musts' around in anything but policy (perhaps only unbreakable/unmodifiable policy) and you'll get a lot of irate editors, scientific or not.
:*&quot;Although publication creates verifiability and reputable journals are reliable sources, publication by itself is not a sufficient (and sometimes not necessary) standard for encyclopedic notability. Unpublished research fails no original research and often lacks verifiability, so it is unacceptable by policy. Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to Wikipedia's policy on neutrality, in particular the section on undue weight. This guideline clarifies how the Wikipedia community has applied NPOV to articles on scientific topics. It does however not apply to the inclusion of scientific research as authorative sources within articles. The criterion for such sources is not that they are notable, but that they are reliable.&quot;
::Wha?  Could this be any more complex?  I actually had to diagram this paragraph out to understand it.  My hypothesis is most editors will not.  Can't you simply say it is normally necessary to follow the general notability guidelines with respect to neutral, multiple, independent, verifiabile, reliable sources?  And if you do that, what is the point of this whole section - I'm seriously not understanding how this adds anything to present guidelines.
* Criteria / General
:*&quot;1. Widely cited. Papers covering the topic have been widely1 commented on in academic writing within the topic's field.
::2. Outside notability. The topic is notable due to significant coverage in reliable sources outside of academic publications.&quot;  
::So we want articles only commented upon widely by multiple academic sources, which also are commented on outside academic sources?  Seems pretty wide, to me.
::Aside from that, I know I read somewhere that Wikipedia is not just a general encyclopedia, but can cover articles appropriate to special subject encyclopedias as well.  Thus 2. might well fail, as most specialist encyclopedias I am aware of have many articles which would only be known inside the discipline the encyclopedia represents.
:*&quot;Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific... [etc.]&quot;
::Boy, I'm going to love the AfDs which try to define whether a topic is &quot;science&quot; or not trying to use this.  Not to mention the arguments you'll get whether or not cosmology (for example) has a scientific basis or not.  Not to mention you're setting up a criteria which is so subjective it will rarely-if-ever be able to objectively define where this guideline would be relevant or not.
::Also, you will get editors asking whether the guideline itself applies or not - something I don't think I've ever seen with any of the other specialty N's about the guideline ''itself''.  I don't need to know if Burpa-Cola has been covered in the Cola News and CNN, or if Billy Bob Arthbutnott has both parlimentary opinions as well as the Sun documenting his career to know that Corp or People:Politicians applies.
*Scientific terms
:Again, how does this get beyond neologisms in a way that Avoid Neologisms doesn't, aside from adding the words &quot;scientific literature&quot;?
*Numbers and Sources
:*&quot;1. Have professional mathematicians published papers on this topic?
::2. Is the sequence listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences? (In the case of sequences of rational numbers, does the OEIS have the sequences of numerators and denominators of the relevant fractions?)
::3. Do MathWorld and PlanetMath have articles on this topic?&quot;
:::This may be taken from WProj numbers, I don't know.  But are you stipulating that 2 and 3 are reliable sources? (The Sources section has exactly this same problem.  You're controlling what is considered a Reliable Source without allowing the Wikipedia community at large to define that.  I have a problem with that - if I were arguing Notability(Religion), I would not want it to say that the Bible is an authorized source and any other 'holy' texts by default would have to prove themselves.)
*Sources
:*&quot;Scientific discovery is often disconnected from public discourse, so standard methods of sourcing and verifying are not always applicable. A scientific topic which yields low hit counts in the Google test...&quot;
::That's nice.  The Google test is widely regarded as discredited anyway.  Yes, I know it's still used, but it's questionability is known.
::Also, verifying and sourcing is verfying and sourcing.  I believe what's being aimed at here is scientific notability may have a smaller and different base (with different types of sourcing) for inclusion than other forms of notability.  So why not say that?  Except that above you're demanding 'popular' coverage as well as academic.
:*&quot;Web (and library) searches should therefore be evaluated based on the quality rather than the quantity of the finds.&quot;
::Thus, you allow extreme subjectivity creep, unless you are going to make further instruction creep in what constitutes scientific quality.  (My Jung is better than your Freud.  My Hawking beats your Einstein.  My t test is better than your bean counting.)  Common sense might be able to dictate that, but science is full of periods of flying in the face of qualitative common sense and succeeding - because it's right.
:*&quot;The following is a list of sources with qualifications of their usefulness.&quot;
::Again, you're preaching what is and isn't acceptable as a source, without allowing the community consensus to decide this over time. 
:*&quot;Google, Yahoo.... [etc]&quot; 
::Uh, again, how is this any different from Google test?

Finally, may I invite you to consider that most notability guidelines are much less complex and much more tolerant of letting individual cases be decided as individual cases?  And I hope that the question about &quot;Have we reached consensus?&quot; is asking if you as the editors have reached consensus about what you want to present to the community as a whole, as opposed to &quot;Are we ready to make this policy ourselves?&quot;

It may seem like I'm pissing all over your proposal.  I hope it doesn't, because I'd like to see a Notability(Science) guideline.  But I want it to be one that's usable and used - I wouldn't do either with this, and I'd argue as need be when someone tries to use this as a vote justification (which will happen, whether you want it to or not.)  Sorry for the length of the diatribe.

The rejected tag is appropriate and should stand until there is adequate discussion here to demonstrate active interest in the proposal.

It looks like a number of the contributors here are no longer active at WP: Lantreman ws banned, BDJ and Science Appologist have quit, Minder Binder, Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri, and Laughing Vulcan have not contributed substantially since June and at all since mid-July.   &lt;s&gt;Trials and Errors and Radiant are advocating reinstating this as a proposal&lt;/s&gt;, but I don't think that there are enough editors who see this as a need.

* What I see now is something that is so watered down and nebulous that it cannot act as a genuine policy.  If people want to revive this effort, then we need to return to a version like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;oldid=117329647 this one] and work from there.  IMO, what happenned to this effort is that a number of people whose pet articles were running afoul of this proposed policy chose to get involved with the blatant intent to sabotage it and remove its impact on their work, and unfortunately succeeded in doing so.&lt;br&gt;IMO, there is a genuine need for a policy like this to clarify what &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiability&quot; mean in the context of a science article, and how [[WP:UNDUE]] should be applied.  It may be that this is an issue that is best handled by the admins with the advice and consent of the community so that we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:49, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
*I see, if not frequent, so at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0 recurrent use] of this guideline/proposed guideline/essay, very much in keeping with the rather low number of science-related AfD discussions. Absence of discussion on the talk page certainly doesn't establish rejection. I agree with EMS that the two-item version is watered down beyond recognition of the original version, and I don't see any consensus for it. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 16:07, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:: Per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]: ''&quot;A rejected page is any proposal for which consensus support is not present, regardless of whether there is active discussion or not. Consensus need not be fully opposed; if consensus is neutral on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal is likewise rejected. It is considered bad form to hide this fact, e.g. by removing the tag. Making small changes will not change this fact, nor will repetitive arguments. Generally it is wiser to rewrite a rejected proposal from scratch and start in a different direction.&quot;'' --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:14, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

::: It seems to me that a lot of work has gone into turning this into something that everyone can reject.  I have now reverted the article back to a more robust form, and hope that the process of making it a serious part of Wikpedia's policies and guidelines can now recomemnce. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:27, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

== Reverted to earlier version ==

I have reverted the article to the form of lat March, with some twaking of the lead and the first section.  The revised first section now has a simple first paragraph that states the need to this policy as succinctly as I can.  The next two paragraphs have had their order exchanged so that the farily dry &quot;relevance&quot; paragraph comes last.  The previous last paragraph has been removed as an unreadable mess.  (I believe I drafted that paragraph originally, but it really never worked as intended, and only got worse over time.)

The {{tl|rejected}} tag has been kept as a matter of form, with the {{tl|proposed}} tag just commented out but still present.  I for one would be happy to see this version go back to &quot;proposed&quot; status, but I want to see if others are on-board for doing that.  Let's just say that after having taken a rest, I am ready and willing to work towards acceptance of a functional version of this as a policy or guideline if others are. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:24, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I don't see a lot of point reviving this.  The criteria have always been an attempt to change practice rather than an attempt to document practice, and to most people, the criteria and the proposal are one and the same.  The criteria really haven't caught on, and from my experience, people rely on other policies for scientific topics, like [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]], and where notability is needed, the general [[WP:N]] seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted.

:: Having looked more closely at the edit history, I find that your attempt to streamline this two two items has met fairly stiff resistance.  Then again, that is little wonder since your proposed consolidation ends up being little more than a restatement of pre-existing policy.  The goal of this proposal is to set up guidelines that go beyond the current policies and which are adapted to the issues which are unique to science.  Wikiepdia has very much outgrown [[WP:NOR|&quot;No original research&quot;]] and the requirement to use [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal|journals]].  What do you do with a source that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but where the peers are fellow followers of a [[fringe science|fringe theory]]?  What do you do about the use of [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], which is highly respected but does not use peer review to help select its articles?  What do you make of a theory published in a respected scientific journals but on which noone has cared to comment except the author?  What do you do with the [[cold fusion]] controversy created by Pons and Fleishman back in 1987 which obviously is notable within science but which was never respected by it?  There will not be many of these to contend with, but when they do appear this guideline will be invaluable.
:::::Please excuse my comment here, but the article content of Nature is peer reviewed. Like some other journals, it has on rare occasions published things based on consensus of the key editors, without formal peer review. The news content is not, of course, just editorially prepared -- by the most careful people around. It was they who caught the similarity of the stem cell photos after the peer reviewers missed it.

:: You like to cite [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as a place where this guideline did not work.  For that I solidly disagree.  That article's creator had to play all kinds of games with these criteria to make a case for keeping the article.  In the end, his attempts to make the article look acceptable only helped to do it in.  In context this is a farly powerful tool.  In addition, it is not going to do in fringe science articles.  For example, I helped by have an aritcle on a book by [[Halton Arp]] kept because it was noted within the field of astronomy and also gained some measure of attention from the public at large.  That press coverage (both scientific and popular) could establish notability as described here was helpful in that discussion. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:03, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You might note that my reduction to two criteria stood for over two months without comment.  You may also note that coverage by press and by scientific sources were the criteria I left in place, since those are the only part of the criteria that are useful.  What I object to are the other criteria, like &quot;textbook science&quot; or &quot;popular belief&quot; that are redundant and provide loopholes for argumentative POV pushers.  Can you hypothesize an example where a topic is &quot;textbook science&quot; or has a &quot;prominent advocate&quot; or has &quot;institutional support&quot; where the topic would be acceptable for Wikipedia ''without'' significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, academic or otherwise?

::::I am not sure whether I agree with you or not. I certainly think that there are science articles that are best referenced by standard textbooks, particularly for articles that are at the level of high school or early university science. For example, we probably do not want to source a peer reviewed journal on [[density]] and we do not. Are textbooks reliable sources? If so we do not need to mention &quot;textbook science&quot;, but if they are not, we probable do. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:09, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::::: I see no need to leave such things as &quot;texstbook science&quot; implicit.

::::::: As for the other criteria: you agree on 3 and 4.  6 is totally pointless, because none of the criteria would expire once met.  7 obviously must require sourcing to back it up or it's totally vacuous and anyone could claim it about anything.  And anything discussed in a legitimate textbook is already covered in a reliable source, and I highly doubt that we'd ever find a case where one textbook mentions a topic but absolutely no other sources do.  Yeah, I agree, if we pare it any further, the ''criteria'' say nothing more than [[WP:N]] does.. so maybe we should lose the criteria altogether, or just spend more time explaining the issues that arise in assessing the quality of sources, especially academic ones.

(unindent) I think that you have just made an excellent suggestions in calling for an explanation of how to assess the reliability and relevance of sources.  Given some of the issues I have had recently with the anti-relativists over at [[talk:Herbert Dingle]], this makes a lot of sense.  (In those discussions, at least one person would take anything that he could find from a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; as evidence of a conflict over relativity and the [[twin paradox]].  Said contributions come from almost unknown overseas journals and in another case a blatantly anti-relativity publisher.)  I would still keep the remaining criteria as a way of saying that those things are the primary hallmarks of scientific notability, while noting that other options for notability are not prohibited. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:20, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I believe that's better, but I still think we should remove the criteria.  The problem is, people always seem to conflate a notability guideline and its criteria, while all other text is ignored.  By not having criteria, we would force people to read the discussion about the reliability of scientific sources.  (Actually, come to think about it, &quot;Notability (science)&quot; may not be the best name.  What about &quot;Reliable sources (scientific)&quot;?)

:: The criteria don't exist for the benefit of those that would abuse them but instead for the benefit of those that are looking for good guidance on what is acceptable.  The creator of an article will invariably try to defend it against an AfD.  IMO, if the article's creator can make a case that their article is acceptable under this criteria and everyone agrees, then these criteria have done a service in helping people to make that decision.  Similarly, if people listen to the creator's case and conclude that it does not hold water, then the criteria will also have helped by focussing the debate on the relevant issues and helping to bring about the deletion.  So as I see it these criteria overall are helpful.  Besides, it really is in the absense of clear guidelines that you get the nastiest debates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:01, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

(a) Notability, (b) reliability of a source, and (b) reliable of the facts in that source, are all quite different, and tell us how to describe information, not whether to include it.

==Abandon this as an unnecessary complication==

Whether a peer review journal, a textbook, a popular book, a university hosted website or a notable persons personal site  is sufficiently reliable, reputable, or secondary is probably best treated on a case by case basis, and in any case this is not a problem specific to science.

Are there any controversial articles that are better treated by Notability (science) than by WP:NOR, WPV, and WP:N?  I think not.  I think there are too many guidelines, especially where they overlap.  True science should only need to satisfy WP:NOR and WP:V.  Where the subject is not true science, or is borderline, a further test should be simply whether others have written about it.  WP:N provides this test.  A lot of work has been invested in this project page, but that is not sufficient reason to adopt it.  It is rule creep, and it does damage by obfuscating more important policies and guidelines.

There seems to be tendency here for some to want a guideline to provide a science-quality test.  This is not an encyclopaedia’s role.  The ascribing of “Finge science”, “pseudo science” or “lunacy” to any theory is a job for third party sources, not for wikipedia rules.  

EMS suggests that some nasty debates exist because of the weakness of this guideline.  Some elaboration would be nice.  Discussion above suggests to me that the relativity article needs work, not that wikipedia needs more rules.

This project page should be abandoned.  Science is well covered by WP:OR and WP:V, and where notability is needed, the general WP:N seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted. --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 02:08, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::OK.  I looked at them.  It seems to me that there aren’t very many, and none of them are really science issues.  Science is merely involved.  It’s always about sourcing, specifically whether the sources are sufficiently independent, sufficiently secondary, sufficiently reputable (not a blog or similar), or covers the subject in sufficient depth.  These are all straight WP:N issues, deriving directly from a combination of WP:NOR and WP:V.  There is plenty of evidence of spirited debate in places about the science of the content involved, and this sometimes is uncivil, but such spirited debate seems to me to be irrelevant to the debates, and always a symptom of editors who are too far into OR editing and are not looking at the subject objectively.  This is why Notability (science) may do more harm than good.  It suggests that there is something special about science.  The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia do not depend upon the science.

==physics? i think not==
do not confuse the observer effect with the uncertainty principle. the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with &quot;observing&quot;, it has to do with measuring. the observer effect is a supposed effect of observing an event and the influence of your presence on the event. no one would ever have to actually observe a particle's position to obfuscate its momentum, the mere act of using the photons to measure its position, even if nobody ever observed it, would suffice.

-------------
don't you have to observe in order to measure?
-------------

Indeed.  But what does measuring have to do with Quantum Mechanics exactly?  

To measure is to observe the results of a measurement process [that ascertains the subject measurement].  Humans observe with their senses — the senses that humans have.  Other conscious beings, perhaps including computers, may have other senses with which they can implement tools for making measurements.  At the end of the day, measuring ''ALWAYS'' involves observing.  

Tools used by beings to make measurements are limited (in their accuracy) by various factors including the limitations of ones senses.  The often-mentioned example of bouncing a photon off of an atom to measure its position illustrates the problem with knowing the position ''AND'' momentum of ''THAT'' atom at the ''SAME MOMENT'' in time.  The concept usually centers on the fact that the position measurement photon will change the momentum of the subject atom.  But aren't there other aspects of this problem?  

In the limit (considering the non-zero mass of the atom and the non-zero energy of the photon), can one ever know perfectly even the position alone?  Perhaps so, since the mechanical inertance of the atom precludes its reaction at ''THAT'' infinitesimal instant in time.  

Why is not ''THIS'' example an instance of &quot;observer effect&quot; rather than the uncertainty principle, per se?  If one seeks only to measure the position alone, then maybe it is neither.  Then again, is it not &quot;Observer Effect&quot; even if the momentum is changed by measuring only the position?  One would think so.  

Well, what if we start with measuring the momentum &quot;first&quot;?  How does one measure momentum, anyway?  Again, we observers devise a measurement process that allows our senses to detect the &quot;answer.&quot;  Momentum is mass times velocity.  If we know the mass, we might then seek to measure the velocity.  Human observers tend to ascertain velocity by measuring position at two points in time.  For non-zero velocities, this means two different points in space, of course.  Yet, [instantaneous] velocity is ''DEFINED'' at only one point in space and time.  Thus, one cannot measure velocity (or momentum) in this manner: one must ''WAIT'' to ''SEE'' how fast it is moving, and this yields only an average (not instantaneous) value.  

Before continuing on to propose measuring momentum, per se, by some other means (say, smashing the atom into an obstacle at a known position), we should note that the Uncertainty Principle pertains only to Quantum Mechanics.  In ''THAT'' world, particles are not particles; rather, they are probability density functions.  The interpretation of this ''MODEL'' of a particle says the position and momentum of the subject particle are INHERENTLY uncertain by virtue of the mathematical model itself.  To precisely derive the position, one must manipulate the model in a manner that causes the momentum &quot;to drop out of the formula,&quot; and vice versa.  

The relationship between position and momentum described by Quantum Mechanics is somewhat like the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain described by the Fourier Transform.  One can say that there is some similarity as well between position and velocity in Classical Mechanics.  In fact, the description above with knowing the velocity versus position of the atom is exactly that: Classical Mechanics. 

Following this line of thinking, one (''such as this user who is not fluent in the intricate semantics of Quantum Theory'') might be likely to reach these conclusions: 
 

'''1. Using &quot;particulate&quot; atoms and photons to describe the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics is ''flat wrong''.''' 

'''2. One does not observe Quantum Mechanics.  Rather, one uses that theory to make calculations to explain the observations of certain experiments.'''

'''3. Measurements ''ALWAYS'' involve observations and therefore also ''ALWAYS'' involve the Observer Effect.  Perhaps this ''IS'' the “Theory of the Observer Effect.”'''

'''4. The Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect are ''fundamentally'' unrelated.'''  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JimRodgers|JimRodgers]] ([[User talk:JimRodgers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JimRodgers|contribs]]) 12:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

For some reason this article is more focused on what the observer effect is not. --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

From what I understood from other sources, the observer effect is basically the collapsing of a quantum system's wavefunction that happens the moment a measurement in made upon it (by an &quot;observer&quot;), therefore cancelling any superposition that may have existed beforehand, and giving specific definition to the renderings. Is this correct? --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:21, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

The text is the following:

...From this point of view, there is no 'observer effect', only one vastly entangled quantum system. A significant minority still find the equations point to an observer; Wheeler, who probably worked more deeply on this subject than any physicist thus far, devised a graphic in which the universe was represented by a &quot;U&quot; with an eye on one end, turned around and viewing itself, to describe his understanding...

==Suggestions==
Current article states &quot;not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car&quot;.
Add a paragraph that illustrates this with the driveshaft of the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche 928.
Also industrial examples and diagrams from mechanical engineering and classical mechanics.
e.g. a torque tube to allign parts of a hinge operated by two hydraulic cylinders.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/206.188.57.60|206.188.57.60]] ([[User talk:206.188.57.60|talk]]) 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

== Diagrams ==

==Accuracy==
This page is not really accurate. Cars like the STS, Corvette, etc. have independent rear suspensions, and the torque tube is not used to transmit acceleration forces in these vehicles. Rather, it is because they have trans-axles in the rear of the car and it connects the trans-axle with the engine in the front. However, I am not enough of an expert on the subject to write a clear and well-written clarification so I have just added some templates to the top of the page. --[[User:Ozziegt|Ozziegt]] ([[User talk:Ozziegt|talk]]) 21:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvette since at least 1988 doesn't have a torque tube (unless they put one in later), and apart from the Miata I'm hard pushed to think of an IRS that uses one. I agree, this article is pretty horrid, it needs a rewrite rather than refs. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:13, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvettes since the late 90's do indeed have torque tubes, of the same type that the Porsche 924/944/928 etc use.  All the mentioned Porsches are IRS and use a torque tube.  Part of the probem with this article is that it lumps very diverse systems together;  the early Ford systems are completely different from the Corvette/Porsche systems.  Both are classified as torque tubes, but the article does not focus on the essence of a TT, which is the use of a smaller torque-transmitting element inside a carrier. The carrier may or may not be static and may or may not be carrying driveline forces (like the Fords). [[User:52FordF-1|52FordF-1]] ([[User talk:52FordF-1|talk]]) 15:44, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yup my bad, 2005 Corvette (as a random example) uses a transaxle and a torque tube. Note that the Corvette system is different to the Peugoet one, as the latter includes an articulating joint at the front whereas the Corvette system does not. This is a big deal, to a driveline engineer at least.[[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:Agreed. The article as written is essentially BS. A torque tube fundamentally counteracts the torque of the driveshaft; the alternative is that the torque is counteracted by the torsional rigidity of the frame (the net torque must, obviously, be zero otherwise the rear of the car would rotate). The torque tube often does transfer forward wheel force to the front of the car, but this is not inherent in the mere fact of having a torque tube: there must still be a mechanism locating the wheels longitudinally relative to the diff/transaxle. This is analogous to the usual need to locate the wheels relative to the frame (most simply, with leaf springs) in order to move the car forward.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.175.57.184|110.175.57.184]] ([[User talk:110.175.57.184|talk]]) 05:05, 18 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== simple definition? ==

It has been my understanding from looking through service manuals and talking to mechanics that the corvette style torque tubes are just an enclosed driveshaft that connects a front mounted engine to the rear mounted transmission (with fully independent rear suspension)

I guess it's not simply called a 'driveshaft' in a classical sense since it doesn't connect a front mounted transmission to the rear differential  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.57.87.173|184.57.87.173]] ([[User talk:184.57.87.173|talk]]) 20:38, 15 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

'''''Hello!'''''

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

*'''Pick an image name.'''
:When [[Special:Upload|uploading]] an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

*'''Source the image.'''
:On the [[Help:Image page|image description page]], explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

*'''Provide copyright and license information.'''
:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
::''If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created'' (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]], then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the [[GFDL]] (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the [[public domain]] (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate [[WP:ICT|tag]] on the [[Wikipedia:image description page|image description page]], like &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL|GFDL]]}} or &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}, you may also want to use &amp;#123;{[[Template:NoRightsReserved|NoRightsReserved]]}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
::''If you didn't create the image,'' or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might &quot;create&quot;, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another [[WP:ICT|tag]] that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of [[WP:FORKS|sites]] which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as &quot;only for use by Wikipedia&quot;, or &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot;, or &quot;for educational use&quot;.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under [[WP:FU|fair use]], but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

*'''Describe the image.'''
:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

'''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Image guidelines|Copyrights]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|Copyright tags]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Fair use|Fair use]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image description page|Image description page]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Granting work into the public domain|Public domain]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion|Images for deletion]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images|Possibly unfree images]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Uploading images|Uploading images]]'''

An '''anti-submarine missile'''  is a [[standoff missile|standoff]] [[anti-submarine weapon]]. Often a variant of [[anti-ship missile]] designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a [[jet engine|jet]] or [[rocket engine|rocket]] engine, to deliver: an [[explosive material|explosive]] [[warhead]] aimed directly at a [[submarine]]; a [[depth charge]], or;  a homing [[torpedo]] that is carried from a launch ship, or other  platform, to the vicinity of a target.
[[File:Ikara missile.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]], an [[Australia]]n-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a [[rocket engine|rocket]]-parachute delivery system carried an [[acoustic torpedo]] up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a [[Nuclear depth bomb|nuclear depth charge]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[File:Maille-Braize-14.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The [[Malafon]], used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch&lt;/small&gt;. ]]

==History==
[[Depth charge]]s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged [[submarine]]s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard [[sonar]] was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. 

Various [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type projectors, including [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] and [[squid (weapon)|squid]], were devised during [[World War II]] to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John ''The Battle of the Atlantic'' (1977) Dial Press {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-8037-6454-2}} pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], [[missile]]s were developed to provide greater range with reduced [[recoil]]. Some missiles and rockets carry [[homing torpedo]]es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard ''Weyer's Warships of the World'' (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''northern river shark''' or '''New Guinea river shark''' (''Glyphis garricki'') is a [[species]] of [[requiem shark]], in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Requiem shark|Carcharhinidae]] found in scattered [[tidal river]]s and associated coastal waters in northern [[Australia]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large [[tide]]s, with immature sharks ranging into [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[brackish water]]. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Northern river sharks are likely [[piscivorous]]. This species is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the [[wet season]]. Very rare and facing threats from [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing]], and perhaps also [[habitat degradation]], this species has been assessed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by [[New Zealand]] [[ichthyologist]] [[Jack Garrick]], after whom the species was eventually  named. This shark was referred to as &quot;''Glyphis'' sp. C&quot; until 2008, when it was formally described by [[Leonard Compagno]], William White, and [[Peter R. Last]] in a [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] paper. The [[type specimen]] is a female {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, collected from the [[East Alligator River]], [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |author2=W.T.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern river shark has been reported from [[King Sound]], the [[Ord River]], and Doctors Creek near [[Derby, Western Australia]], the [[Adelaide River|Adelaide]] and [[Alligator Rivers]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], and the [[Daru]] region and possibly the [[Fly River]] in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large [[river]]s, [[estuaries]], and coastal [[bay]]s, all of which are characterized by high [[turbidity]], silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water ([[salinity]] ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pillans, R.D. |author2=J.D.

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with [[nictitating membrane]]s. Each [[nostril]] is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30&amp;ndash;35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The [[pelvic fin]]s are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The [[anal fin]] is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The [[caudal fin]] has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The [[dermal denticle]]s are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This species differs from the [[speartooth shark]] (''G. glyphis'') in several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[meristic]] characters, including having fewer [[vertebra]]e (137&amp;ndash;151 versus 213&amp;ndash;222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], the northern river shark seems to be [[adaptation|adapted]] for hunting [[fish]] in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill.

Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other requiem sharks, this species is [[viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s forming a [[placenta]]l connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of [[yolk]]. Females give birth around October, before the start of the [[wet season]], on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;/&gt; The young are born at under {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males [[sexual maturity|mature]] between lengths of {{convert|1.2|and|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while females mature between lengths of {{convert|1.4|and|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; This species is caught legally and illegally by [[commercial fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[gillnet]]s, as well as by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]; [[habitat degradation]] may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the northern river shark as [[critically endangered]]. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;white et al&quot;/&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zoidberg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zoidberg~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hare Krishna picture ==

There is a picture of a Hare Krishna procession in the [[Religion_in_Mexico#Buddhism|Buddhism]] section, even with a caption about them being buddhists. Hare Krishnas are not buddhists, they are hindus. The article is semi-protected so I can not correct that myself. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wenzelkarbovski|Wenzelkarbovski]] ([[User talk:Wenzelkarbovski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wenzelkarbovski|contribs]]) 17:39, 22 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Self-ascription fallacy ==

''The last census reported, by self-ascription, that over 95% of the population is Christian.''

The so-called self-ascription of the census is nothing but a silly way of measuring data. Obviously they count children as Christians just because their parents say so. This people should either be clear about this or not count children at all. By the way, since a couple of years ago the Catholic Church has started to indoctrinate [[Huichol]] kids. Shame on us, Mexicans. Shame on us... The Huichols were one of the very few indigenous people whose religious tradition haven't been polluted by Catholicism but now the church has started taking advantage of the poverty of this people and the new constitutional reforms to infiltrate to their villages and improvise &quot;schools&quot;. Of course they know that adults wouldn't let themselves be indoctrinated so they choose to attack young minds. Catholicism and ignorance have been the ingredients of our condition as a Third World country.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scandza|Scandza]] ([[User talk:Scandza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scandza|contribs]]) 13:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Can anyone explain why the Evangelical Free Church of America does so many, many missionary trips to Mexico, when it's a predominantly catholic country? I mean, there are definite ideological differences involved, but I wasn't aware the two churches actively tried to convert each other's members.


==First phrase==

Any interest in removing &quot;Unlike some other Latin American countries&quot; from the first sentence of the article? It does not seem to serve any objective purpose and seems slightly antagonistic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Namenderkrieg|Namenderkrieg]] ([[User talk:Namenderkrieg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Namenderkrieg|contribs]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Easter==

I'm removing this:

&quot;Some of them however, do not celebrate Easter because they think that the Easter Bunny is the devil. Instead of celebrating Easter, they like to eat Mexican Pizzas.&quot;

because it's obviously untrue and just stupid. I think the article should be rewritten though, by someone more experienced than I am.--[[User:PARCGOP|PARCGOP]] 14:09, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Contradiction?==
This article says that 95% of people in Mexico are Roman Catholic.  The Mexico article states that 95% of people are Christian, and only 89% are Roman Catholic.  Which is correct, or am I just confused?
[[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 02:20, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rewriting ==

I have imported the Religion section from the article on [[Mexico]] and integrated the information that was only on this article. I also moved around paragraphs and added a subtitle to make reading easier. Finally I removed the stub templates and replaced it with the expand one. --[[User:Marianika|Marianika]] ([[User talk:Marianika|talk]]) 16:32, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== What about non-believers? ==

What about atheists, agnostics, deists in Mexico? How many Mexicans actually believe in God? Is there any data about that?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.196.243.113|213.196.243.113]] ([[User talk:213.196.243.113|talk]]) 22:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

This article lacks a part about the growing movement of Mexicayotl, or Ethnic Mexican Culture or Religion, which is the revival of &quot;Aztec&quot; religion. --[[Special:Contributions/79.45.49.143|79.45.49.143]] ([[User talk:79.45.49.143|talk]]) 12:47, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

There's a typo in the Nonreligion section - an extraneous &quot;sus&quot; - but I don't know what it should read. [[User:MaxwellPerkins|MaxwellPerkins]] ([[User talk:MaxwellPerkins|talk]]) 05:05, 28 March 2011 (UTC)

'''John Ralph Ragazzini''' (January 3, 1912&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;dq=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC4sew9dPVAhXMHJoKHeWmAFsQ6AEIKzAB Profile of John Ralph Ragazzini]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 22, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and a professor of [[Electrical Engineering]]. 

==Biography==
Ragazzini was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the [[City College of New York]] in 1932 and 1933 and earned the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [[Columbia University]] in 1939 and 1941.

Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at [[New York University]] and during [[World War II]] he was chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where he was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]].

Ragazzini's notable students are [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (see [[Kalman filter]]s), [[Eliahu Ibraham Jury]] (see [[Z-transform]]), [[Gene F. Franklin]] (see [[digital control]]), and [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] (see [[Fuzzy sets]] and [[Fuzzy logic]]).

Ragazzini is also credited, along with Lotfi Zadeh, in 1952, to have pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in [[discrete-time]] [[signal processing]] and analysis.

In 1970 he received the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[American Automatic Control Council]] named [[John R. Ragazzini Award]] after Ragazzini and he was the first recipient of the award. Ragazzini died on 22 November 1988, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/obituaries/john-ragazzini-76-educator-and-engineer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair use rationale for Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]].

The '''United Church, Chapel on the Hill''' in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was the city's main church during [[World War II]]. Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational [[chapel]] shared by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchhistory&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 Church History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092956/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural design ==
The building design is a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] 700-series [[U.S. Army]] chapel.&lt;ref name=Townsite&gt;[http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf Chapel on the Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124718/http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }} in ''Jackson Square – the original Townsite'', Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]]d [[bell tower]] and a [[gable]] entry [[porch]]. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_(Preferred).pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Oak Ridge Historic District |date=July 18, 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829041710/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_%28Preferred%29.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the &quot;townsite&quot; area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included [[prayer]]s and talks by a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, a [[Baptist]] minister, and the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), ''City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946''. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name, &quot;The Chapel on the Hill,&quot; comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.&lt;ref name=Townsite/&gt;

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main [[cafeteria]]. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by [[laity|layperson]]s, to include all denominations. A [[Presbyterian]] minister working in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of &quot;the United Church&quot;. Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=pre1980&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Pre-1980 Historical Compilation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093006/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the [[Manhattan Project]] community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, [[wedding]]s, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as [[Sunday school]] classes in several local schools and a [[mobile home|trailer]] camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single [[interdenominational]] congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and {{convert|3.72|acre|ha}} of land from the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt; An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957. The facility continues to operate as a nondenominational Protestant church under lay leadership, employing ministers with backgrounds in [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainstream Protestant]] denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Don Goodwin, [http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=55 &quot;The United Church&quot; (1980) and &quot;A Unique and Lonely Path&quot; (2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093011/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 it has been affiliated with the [[Center for Progressive Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=175&amp;Itemid=49 The 8 Points of Progressive Christianity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304033528/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=175&amp;Itemid=49 |date=March 4, 2012 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The church's motto is &quot;Where People from All Denominations Meet in Their Differences, but Are One in Their Search for God.&quot;&lt;ref name=churchhistory/&gt;

== GA nom on Hold for 7 days ==

Hi,

Looking pretty good here. I put a couple &lt;nowiki&gt;{{fact}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags on it. Just try to look for stuff that people might put in a book report, or that might people say &quot;Really?&quot; and cite the reference. But this article is actually right on the bare edge of passing, just as it is.

I looked as the supplied reference for the phrase &quot;Bob failed to organize significantly...&quot; and didn't see anything about failure to organize. I didn't look at any other refs; did you get them right?

Good work!
--[[User:Ling.Nut|Ling.Nut]] 02:04, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

:I added one source for the intro, but the rest are there. The source is at the end of the section, not at the end of every sentence. The WPTC does it this way. Having a reference for every last sentence would be overkill, so we just put a reference at the end of every time we use the source. The phrase &quot;Bob failed to organize significantly&quot; isn't in that source; rather it is indirectly stated. The source from which it comes from indicate it didn't strengthen, and most of the convection was to the south of the center. [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;) 02:29, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
::Who am I to argue with WPTC? '''PASS'''.--[[User:Ling.Nut|Ling.Nut]] 02:42, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
:::Cool :) [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;) 02:45, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

==A-class==
Why is it that this is the only A-class article I have seen? Most articles are either GA or FA. [[User:Juliancolton|Juliancolton]] ([[User talk:Juliancolton|talk]]) 12:40, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

:There are [[:Category:A-Class hurricane articles|7 A-class articles]], which are similar to FA class in quality, but they haven't gone through an FAC run. [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;) 15:52, 8 December 2007 (UTC)
::So then why don't we send this A-class to FAC? [[User:Juliancolton|Juliancolton]] ([[User talk:Juliancolton|talk]]) 17:20, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

:::Just because an article is at A-class doesn't mean we should send them all to FAC. There are more than 50 articles on FAC, including one hurricane article, and two hurricane articles are on Peer Review. We should focus on them first so we don't overload the FAC system, since the WPTC typically usually gets few comments on hurricane FAC's. That said, as the author, I'll think about taking this one to FAC. [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;) 18:39, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

::::Is there any real difference between A and FA articles? [[User:Juliancolton|Juliancolton]] ([[User talk:Juliancolton|talk]]) 21:14, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

:::::Yes. A-class articles can be articles that are relatively short but are still of great quality. Additionally, they might not be quite complete, possibly very long and needs some trimming before going for an FA run, or could be a very well-written article on a non-notable article, for which the FA process would be merely to get the FA star. Since A-class articles should have already passed a GA, they are already included in statistics on good articles (most stats on quality articles on WP refer to articles GA or better), so just going through the FA process to get the star is not desirable in some instances. Not every article needs to become an FA, after all. [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;) 21:32, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

::::::I thought the WPTC project page says the goal is to get all tropical cyclone articles featured. [[User:Juliancolton|Juliancolton]] ([[User talk:Juliancolton|talk]]) 22:14, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

:::::::That was an impossible goal set a few years ago, and it has been changed. [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;) 23:06, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

==GA Sweeps Review: Pass==
As part of the [[WP:WGA|WikiProject Good Articles]], we're doing [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force/Sweeps|sweeps]] to go over all of the current GAs and see if they still meet the [[WP:WIAGA|GA criteria]]. I'm specifically going over all of the &quot;Meteorology and atmospheric sciences&quot; articles. I believe the article currently meets the criteria and should remain listed as a [[WP:GA|Good article]]. I have made several minor corrections throughout the article. Altogether the article is well-written and is still in great shape after its passing in 2006. Continue to improve the article making sure all new information is properly sourced and neutral. It would be beneficial to go through the article and update all of the access dates of the inline citations and fix any dead links. If you have any questions, let me know on my talk page and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I have updated the article history to reflect this review. Happy editing! --[[User:Nehrams2020|Nehrams2020]] ([[User talk:Nehrams2020|talk]]) 07:43, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

== FAC review continued ==

*&quot;In Beaufort County, where the storm came ashore, officials closed city and county offices early and advised businesses to send their workers home early.&quot; This is very similar to what is in the source. The [http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=20555201&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;currentResult=4&amp;currentPage=10 source] text is &quot;In Beaufort County, S.C., where the storm center was expected to come ashore, city and county offices were closed early and businesses were advised to send their employees home early as well.&quot;
*&quot;Tropical Storm Bob flooded roads and downed trees in the area.&quot; What is &quot;area&quot; referring to here?

==Merge==
[[Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages]] says that if a page is short and connot be expanded, it makes sense to merge it with another article. Seems to me that there is so little info on all of these short-lived bands ([[The Vegas Kings]], [[Ronnie &amp; The Rumblers|The Rumblers]], etc.) that they should all be merged into one- (I am suggesting [[Ronnie Dio and the Prophets]], the last of them). After all, the only reason these pages exist is to follow Dio's career, and a good deal of that information is already on [[Ronnie James Dio|his page]]. --[[User:Rosencrantz1|Rosencrantz1]] 19:48, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Or if not that, let's at least merge [[The Vegas Kings]] and [[Ronnie &amp; The Rumblers]], as these are actually the same band- just a name change! --[[User:Rosencrantz1|Rosencrantz1]] 20:05, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

I agree with the first recommendation. [[User:Johnpseudo|'''johnpseudo''']] 03:21, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

There, I merged the articles. It maybe needs a bit of tweaking still, but I think it looks pretty good. --[[User:Rosencrantz1|Rosencrantz1]] 23:53, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

'''Open data''' is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Auer | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Bizer | first2 = C. | last3 = Kobilarov | first3 = G. | last4 = Lehmann | first4 = J. | last5 = Cyganiak | first5 = R. | last6 = Ives | first6 = Z. | chapter = DBpedia: A Nucleus for a Web of Open Data | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-76298-0_52 | title = The Semantic Web | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 4825 | pages = 722 | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-540-76297-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of the open data movement are similar to those of other &quot;open&quot; movements such as [[Open-source software movement|open source]], [[open hardware]], [[open content]], [[open government]], [[open access (publishing)|open access]], and [[open science]]. Paradoxically, the growth of the open data movement is paralleled by a rise in intellectual property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Data Revolution|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|publisher=Sage|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4462-8748-4|location=London|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy behind open data has been long established (for example in the [[Merton thesis|Mertonian tradition of science]]), but the term &quot;open data&quot; itself is recent, gaining popularity with the rise of the Internet and [[World Wide Web]] and, especially, with the launch of open-data government initiatives such as [[Data.gov]], [[Data.gov.uk]] and [[Data.gov.in]].

Open data which is also [[linked data]] is usually termed '''linked open data'''. One of the most important forms of open data is open government data, which requires all the government collected data to be made open.

== Overview ==
The concept of open data is not new; but a formalized definition is {{Citation needed span|text=relatively new|date=April 2017|reason=&quot;new&quot; is a relative term. It's not clear especially when the reader doesn't know when the text was written.}}. One definition is the [[The Open Definition|Open Definition]] which can be summarized in the statement that &quot;A piece of data is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it – subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://opendefinition.org/ Open Definition home page] and the [http://opendefinition.org/okd/ full Open Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions, including the Open Data Institute's &quot;[https://theodi.org/what-is-open-data Open data is data that anyone can access, use or share]&quot;, have an accessible short version of the definition but refer to the formal definition.

Open data may include non-textual material such as [[map]]s, [[genome]]s, [[connectome]]s, [[chemical compound]]s, mathematical and scientific formulae, medical data and practice, bioscience and biodiversity. Problems often arise because these are commercially valuable or can be aggregated into works of value. Access to, or re-use of, the data is controlled by organisations, both public and private. Control may be through access restrictions, [[licenses]], [[copyright]], [[patents]] and charges for access or re-use. Advocates of open data argue that these restrictions are against the common good and that these data should be made available without restriction or fee. In addition, it is important that the data are re-usable without requiring further permission, though the types of re-use (such as the creation of derivative works) may be controlled by a license.

A typical depiction of the need for open data:

{{quote|Numerous scientists have pointed out the irony that right at the historical moment when we have the technologies to permit worldwide availability and distributed process of scientific data, broadening collaboration and accelerating the pace and depth of discovery{{nbsp}}... we are busy locking up that data and preventing the use of correspondingly advanced technologies on knowledge.|John Wilbanks, VP Science, Creative Commons&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencecommons.org/ Science Commons]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Creators of data often do not consider the need to state the conditions of ownership, licensing and re-use; instead presuming that not asserting copyright puts the data into the [[public domain]]. For example, many scientists do not regard the published data arising from their work to be theirs to control and consider the act of publication in a journal to be an implicit release of data into the [[commons]]. However, the lack of a license makes it difficult to determine the status of a [[data set]] and may restrict the use of data offered in an &quot;Open&quot; spirit. Because of this uncertainty it is also possible for public or private organizations to [[Aggregate data|aggregate]] said data, protect it with copyright and then resell it.

The issue of [[indigenous knowledge]] (IK) poses a great challenge in terms of capturing, storage and distribution. Many societies in third-world countries lack the technicality processes of managing the IK.

At his presentation at the XML 2005 conference, Connolly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connolly|first1=Dan|title=Semantic Web Data Integration with hCalendar and GRDDL|url=http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/mash/slides|website=W3C Talks and Presentations|publisher=W3C|accessdate=2 May 2015|location=XML Conference &amp; Exposition 2005, Atlanta, Georgia, USA|page=2|date=16 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; displayed these two quotations regarding open data:
* &quot;I want my data back.&quot;  (Jon Bosak circa 1997) {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} 
* &quot;I've long believed that customers of any application own the data they enter into it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Veen|first1=Jeffrey|title=Polar Heart Rate Monitors: Gimme my data!|url=http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000810.html|website=A website by Jeffrey Veen|date=2 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This quote refers to Veen's own heart-rate data.)

==Major sources==
Open data can come from any source.  This section lists some of the fields that publish (or at least discuss publishing) a large amount of open data.

===In science===
{{main|Open science data}}
The concept of '''open access to scientific data''' was institutionally established with the formation of the [[World Data Center]] system, in preparation for the [[International Geophysical Year]] of 1957–1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee on Scientific Accomplishments of Earth Observations from Space, National Research Council|title=Earth Observations from Space: The First 50 Years of Scientific Achievements|year=2008|publisher=The National Academies Press|isbn=0-309-11095-5|page=6|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11991&amp;page=6 |accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Council of Scientific Unions (now the [[International Council for Science]]) oversees several World Data Centres with the mandate to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icsu-wds.org/services/data-sharing-principles|title=Data Sharing Principles|author=World Data System|date=September 27, 2017|website=www.icsu-wds.org|publisher=ICSU-WDS (International Council for Science - World Data Service)|accessdate=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the open-science-data movement long predates the Internet, the availability of fast, ubiquitous networking has significantly changed the context of [[Open science data]], since publishing or obtaining data has become much less expensive and time-consuming.

The [[Human Genome Project]] was a major initiative that exemplified the power of open data. It was built upon the so-called [[Bermuda Principles]], stipulating that: &quot;All human genomic sequence information (…) should be freely available and in the public domain in order to encourage research and development and to maximise its benefit to society'.&lt;ref&gt;Human Genome Project, 1996. Summary of Principles Agreed Upon at the First International
Strategy Meeting on Human Genome Sequencing (Bermuda, 25–28 February 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; More recent initiatives such as the Structural Genomics Consortium have illustrated that the open data approach can also be used productively within the context of industrial R&amp;D.&lt;ref&gt;Perkmann, Markus and Schildt, Henri, Open Data Partnerships between Firms and Universities: The Role of Boundary Organizations, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314002248/pdfft?md5=cb6552dbcdd3eff123da567d199964c5&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S0048733314002248-main.pdf Research Policy] 44 (2015) 1133–1143&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Science Ministers of all nations of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), which includes most developed countries of the world, signed a declaration which essentially states that all publicly funded archive data should be made publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/0,2340,en_2649_34487_25998799_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Declaration on Open Access to publicly funded data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420102950/http://www.oecd.org/document/0%2C2340%2Cen_2649_34487_25998799_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |date=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a request and an intense discussion with data-producing institutions in member states, the OECD published in 2007 the ''OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding'' as a ''soft-law'' recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/55/0,3343,en_2649_201185_38500791_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of open data in science:
* The [[Dataverse]] Network Project – archival repository software promoting data sharing, persistent data citation, and reproducible research&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedata.org/ Dataverse Network Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://data.uni-muenster.de data.uni-muenster.de] –b Open data about scientific artifacts from University of Muenster, Germany. Launched in 2011.
* [http://linkedscience.org/data linkedscience.org/data] – Open scientific datasets encoded as [[Linked Data]]. Launched in 2011.
&lt;!--PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER--&gt;

===In Government===
{{see also|Open Government|PSI Directive}}
{{external links|date=May 2012}}

There are a range of different arguments for Government Open Data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=Jonathan|title=Towards a Genealogy of Open Data|publisher=Social Science Research Network (SSRN)|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2605828|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brito|first=Jerry|title=Hack, Mash, &amp; Peer: Crowdsourcing Government Transparency|url=http://www.stlr.org/volumes/volume-ix-2007-2008/brito/|publisher=Colum. Sci. &amp; Tech. L. Rev. 119 (2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some advocates contend that making government information available to the public as machine readable open data can facilitate government transparency, accountability and public participation. Some make the case that opening up official information can support technological innovation and economic growth by enabling third parties to develop new kinds of digital applications and services.

Several national governments have created web sites to distribute a portion of the data they collect. It is a concept for a collaborative project in municipal Government to create and organize culture for Open Data or Open government data.

Additionally, other levels of government have established open data websites. There are many government entities pursuing [[Open Data in Canada]]. [[Data.gov]] lists the sites of a total of 40 US states and 46 US cities and counties with web sites to provide open data; e.g. the state of [[Maryland StateStat|Maryland]], the state of [[California|California, US]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.data.ca.gov/ data.ca.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the international level, the United Nations has an open data website that publishes statistical data from Member States and UN Agencies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.un.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The World Bank]] published a range of statistical data relating to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] has created two portals for the [[European Union]]: the [[EU Open Data Portal]] which gives access to open data from the EU institutions, agencies and other bodies&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.europa.eu EU Open Data Portal]&lt;/ref&gt; and the PublicData portal that provides datasets from local, regional and national public bodies across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicdata.eu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the [[Open Government Partnership]] launched the [[International Open Data Charter]], a set of principles and best practices for the release of governmental open data formally adopted by seventeen governments of countries, states and cities during the OGP Global Summit in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Open Data Charter: A Roadmap for Using a Global Resource|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joel-gurin/the-open-data-charter-a-r_b_8391470.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for and against==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}
The debate on Open Data is still evolving. The best open government applications seek to empower citizens, to help small businesses, or to create value in some other positive, constructive way. Opening government data is only a way-point on the road to improving education, improving government, and building tools to solve other real world problems. While many arguments have been made categorically{{Citation needed|reason=General statement without proof or an example.|date=May 2017}}, the following discussion of arguments for and against open data highlights that these arguments often depend highly on the type of data and its potential uses.

Arguments made on behalf of Open Data include the following:

* &quot;Data belong to the [[human race]]&quot;. Typical examples are [[genome]]s, data on organisms, medical science, [[environmental data]] following the [[Aarhus Convention]]
* [[Government spending|Public money]] was used to fund the work and so it should be universally available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/central-gov/dispatch-box-road-open-data On the road to open data, by Ian Manocha]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was created by or at a government institution (this is common in US National Laboratories and government agencies)
* [[Fact]]s cannot legally be copyrighted.
* [[Sponsor (commercial)|Sponsors]] of research do not get full value unless the resulting data are freely available.
* Restrictions on data re-use create an anticommons.
* Data are required for the smooth process of running communal human activities and are an important enabler of [[socio-economic development]] (health care, education, [[economic productivity]], etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;HilbertBigData2013&quot;&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2205145 &quot;Big Data for Development: From Information- to Knowledge Societies&quot;], Martin Hilbert (2013), SSRN Scholarly Paper No. ID 2205145. Rochester, NY: Social Science Research Network; http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2205145&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In scientific research, the rate of discovery is accelerated by better access to data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/dsj/6/0/6_S116/_article How to Make the Dream Come True] argues in one research area (Astronomy) that access to open data increases the rate of scientific discovery.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Making data open helps combat &quot;data rot&quot; and ensure that scientific research data are preserved over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khodiyar|first1=Varsha|title=Stopping the rot: ensuring continued access to scientific data, irrespective of age|url=http://blog.f1000research.com/2014/05/19/stopping-the-rot/|website=F1000 Research|publisher=F1000|accessdate=2015-03-11|ref=20150311Khodiyar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Magee AF, May MR, Moore BR | title = The dawn of open access to phylogenetic data | journal = PLOS One | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = e110268 | date = 24 October 2014 | pmid = 25343725 | pmc = 4208793 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0110268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally held that factual data cannot be copyrighted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencecommons.org/about/towards Towards a Science Commons] includes an overview of the basis of Openness in science data.&lt;/ref&gt; However, publishers frequently add copyright statements (often forbidding re-use) to scientific data accompanying publications. It may be unclear whether the factual data embedded in full text are part of the copyright.

While the human abstraction of facts from paper publications is normally accepted as legal there is often an implied restriction on the machine extraction by robots.

Unlike [[Open access (publishing)|Open Access]], where groups of publishers have stated their concerns, Open Data is normally challenged by individual institutions{{Citation needed|reason=Need an example.|date=May 2017}}. Their arguments have been discussed less in public discourse and there are fewer quotes to rely on at this time.

Arguments against making all data available as Open Data include the following:

* Government funding may not be used to duplicate or challenge the activities of the private sector (e.g. [[PubChem]]).
* Governments have to be accountable for the efficient use of taxpayer's money: If public funds are used to aggregate the data and if the data will bring commercial (private) benefits to only a small number of users, the users should reimburse governments for the cost of providing the data.
* The revenue earned by publishing data can be used to cover the costs of generating and/or disseminating the data, so that the dissemination can continue indefinitely.
* The revenue earned by publishing data permits non-profit organisations to fund other activities (e.g. learned society publishing supports the society).
* The government gives specific legitimacy for certain organisations to recover costs ([[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] in US, [[Ordnance Survey]] in UK).
* Privacy concerns may require that access to data is limited to specific users or to sub-sets of the data.
* Collecting, 'cleaning', managing and disseminating data are typically labour- and/or cost-intensive processes – whoever provides these services should receive fair remuneration for providing those services.
* Sponsors do not get full value unless their data is used appropriately – sometimes this requires quality management, dissemination and branding efforts that can best be achieved by charging fees to users.
* Often, targeted end-users cannot use the data without additional processing (analysis, apps etc.) – if anyone has access to the data, none may have an incentive to invest in the processing required to make data useful (typical examples include biological, medical, and environmental data).

==Relation to other open activities==
The goals of the Open Data movement are similar to those of other &quot;Open&quot; movements.

* [[Open access]] is concerned with making scholarly publications freely available on the internet. In some cases, these articles include open datasets as well.
* [[Open content]] is concerned with making resources aimed at a human audience (such as prose, photos, or videos) freely available.
* [[Open knowledge]]. [[Open Knowledge International]] argues for Openness in a range of issues including, but not limited to, those of Open Data. It covers (a) scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise (b) Content such as music, films, books (c) Government and other administrative information. Open data is included within the scope of the Open Knowledge Definition, which is alluded to in [[Science Commons]]' Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/ Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Open notebook science]] refers to the application of the Open Data concept to as much of the scientific process as possible, including failed experiments and raw experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;http://drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.com/2006/09/open-notebook-science.html creation of term&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Open source]] (software) is concerned with the licenses under which computer programs can be distributed and is not normally concerned primarily with data.
* [[Open educational resources]] are freely accessible, openly licensed documents and media that are useful for teaching, learning, and assessing as well as for research purposes. 
* [[Open research]]/[[Open science]]/[[Open science data]] (Linked open science) means an approach to open and interconnect scientific assets like data, methods and tools with [[Linked Data]] techniques to enable transparent, reproducible and transdisciplinary research.&lt;ref name=&quot;kauppinen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kauppinen | first1 = T. | last2 = Espindola | first2 = G. M. D. | doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2011.04.076 | title = Linked Open Science-Communicating, Sharing and Evaluating Data, Methods and Results for Executable Papers | journal = Procedia Computer Science | volume = 4 | pages = 726 | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funders' mandates==
Several funding bodies which mandate Open Access also mandate Open Data. A good expression of requirements (truncated in places) is given by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR):&lt;ref&gt;[https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OpenData/Message/34.html SPARC-OpenData@arl.org Mailing List Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* to deposit bioinformatics, atomic and molecular coordinate data, experimental data into the appropriate public database immediately upon publication of research results.
* to retain original data sets for a minimum of five years after the grant. This applies to all data, whether published or not.

Other bodies active in promoting the deposition of data as well as fulltext include the [[Wellcome Trust]]. An academic paper published in 2013 advocated that [[Horizon 2020]] (the science funding mechanism of the EU, due to launch in 2014) should mandate that funded projects hand in their databases as &quot;deliverables&quot; at the end of the project, so that they can be checked for third party usability then shared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jhsrp.rsmjournals.com/content/early/2013/04/16/1355819613476017.full Galsworthy, M.J. &amp; McKee, M.

==Non-Open data==
Several mechanisms restrict access to or reuse of data (and several reasons for doing this are given above). They include:
* making data available for a charge.
* compilation in databases or websites to which only registered members or customers can have access.
* use of a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] or closed technology or encryption which creates a barrier for access.
* copyright forbidding (or obfuscating) re-use of the data, including the use of &quot;no [[derivative work|derivatives]]&quot; requirements.
* patent forbidding re-use of the data (for example the 3-dimensional coordinates of some experimental protein structures have been patented).
* restriction of robots to websites, with preference to certain search engines.
* [[Aggregate data|aggregating]] factual data into &quot;databases&quot; which may be covered by &quot;[[database rights]]&quot; or &quot;[[database directives]]&quot; (e.g. [[Directive on the legal protection of databases]]).
* time-limited access to resources such as [[e-journal]]s (which on traditional print were available to the purchaser indefinitely).
* &quot;webstacles&quot;, or the provision of single [[data point]]s as opposed to [[tabular]] [[Information retrieval|queries]] or bulk downloads of [[data set]]s.
* political, commercial or legal pressure on the activity of organisations providing Open Data (for example the [[American Chemical Society]] lobbied the US Congress to limit funding to the [[National Institutes of Health]] for its Open [[PubChem]] data).&lt;ref name=&quot;uoc&quot;&gt;[http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/acs_pubchem.html Review of history and positions by the University of California]

==His biography==

I just found one short biography dating back to 1947 in Proceedings of I.R.E see [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/10933/35771/01697380.pdf?isnumber=35771&amp;prod=JNL&amp;arnumber=1697380&amp;arSt=+496&amp;ared=+497&amp;arAuthor=]

I quote it here:

''John R. Ragazzini was born in 1912 and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the City College of New York in 1932 and 1933. He then received the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. at Columbia University in 1939 and 1941. After a brief association with one of the City Departments he became an instructor in the School of Technology at the City College, -and in 1941 joined the faculty of the School of Engineering of Columbia University. During the war he was in charge of two contracts with the Office of Sciqntific Research and Development, one of which involved electronic simulators and computers. He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, and Tau Beta Pi, and is an associate member of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.''

This might be helpful for later edits.

I didn't start this discussion or the article and I apologize in advance for any toes I've stood on.  There's been good work on this article by all contributors, would welcome more and as diverse information as possible. ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 19:48, 30 October 2006 (UTC))

I am glad to see the extra information about the Everest and Kangchenjunga associations and especially the additional photographs.  Many thanks.  You mentioned Chris Briggs on a subject line but not in the text so I have added him to the hotel history, a real oversight.  The mountain rescue plaque is still there but I cannot find an internet reference to P-y-G in that connexion.  I think I prefer the 'thumbs' standard size. [[User:NoelWalley|NoelWalley]] 22:29, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

You are right about the size of the size of the pictures and the reorganisation is better.  Nice touch bringing in Chris Briggs and the mountain rescue. I have some more pictures of the time that Chris  was in charge, with him actually on a mountain rescue, I've also got a picture on Chris with Ed Hillary (its a little battered and needs scanning and then a clean).  His daugther Jane runs Pen-y-Gwryd with her husband Brian.  I think their children, now grown up, are now getting actively involved as well.  There is quite few famous film stars who stayed there, one being &quot;Jack Hawkins&quot;.  ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 09:08, 31 October 2006 (UTC))

It would be great, perhaps too much to hope for, to have a group photograph of the Everest team?  The hotel has a good web-site of its own (and this is linked) with its own history and pictures of the Lockwoods and the Briggs. My own feelings are that it would be too &quot;commercial&quot; for the wiki article to develop much further as an article about the hotel, its present activities and its other former guests. [[User:NoelWalley|NoelWalley]] 10:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

I can find quite a few originals, maybe one early and one later on.  I was rather sad to see my old man looking so ill on the Kangchenjunga photo I'll have a look for an earlier one where more members we alive also, mentally he was as sharp as ever. Agreed on the article's length and content.  I started two knew articles today, Owen Wyn Owen (Babs fame) and Evan Roberts (Botanist) (both from Capel Curig), but very early days as yet.  It will be interesting to follow this, as it looks as though Capel Curig has had more than its fair share of famous people. I'll get onto the Everest shot right away.  ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 12:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC))

Sorry you have removed it, I thought it a great asset. [[User:NoelWalley|NoelWalley]] 17:57, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

Hi Noel, my fault I felt a little guilty about that one as it was not in reality mine to give away at this juncture, although I will ask for persmission.  Even though the phtographer is not known, it did come from a source I need to check out.  Did you take a look at the other two new images.  If I get the ok, I'll put it back. ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 19:41, 31 October 2006 (UTC))

Robin, they are just great!  If you can get permission to reinstate the B&amp;W, it serves to illustrate the North Wales contribution to the planning and the training for these great achievements - not just the later celebrations! Good luck! [[User:NoelWalley|NoelWalley]] 20:43, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

&quot;North Wales contribution to mountaineering and exploration&quot; good point, on that note how do you think I should go about penning an article concerning the training (climbing and Ice climbing in full kit) done in North Wales and the Oxygen equipement testing, which I have the imnages for as well, in and around Snowdon but also at Helyg? It will either need a new title to provide and umbarella to get all the information under OR do you think at this point a book/booklete should be put together.  My father was quoted on the BBC just a few weeks bfore he died, about how good Wales had been to him and how essential the training in Wales had been for these expeditions. Lots and lots of quotations. Jamie Owen's Wales was the program.  Jamie also played back other and different excerpts from his Radio show as well. ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 21:03, 31 October 2006 (UTC))


==Gwynedd Catagory==

Anybody agree that we need to have a better catagory for Gwynedd than &quot;Geography of Gwynedd&quot;, Gwynedd does have Geography, it also has Geology, its own Language, History &amp; Pre-history, Transport, Mountain activities, Sailing, Artists, Writers, etc, etc. Of each catagory listed above there are many instances. Seems far too thin too encompass Gwnedd purely under Geography.  ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 15:35, 6 November 2006 (UTC))

Well there is a catagory Gwynedd, unfortunately they look unorganised, there's a lot of crosstalk. ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 11:42, 7 November 2006 
(UTC))

Added &quot;Tourism in Gwynedd&quot; as a subcategory of Gwynedd.  Tells us more and permits a greater freedom to add articles to that category.  ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 20:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC))


==Pen-y-Gwryd is a place in the landscape of Gwynedd, not just an hotel==

When I expanded this article from a mere stub to three modest paragraphs in June 2006 I was keen to show three aspects of Pen-y-Gwryd (there may of course be more):
# That '''Pen-y-Gwryd''' is a physical location, a watershed, the head of a mountain pass (head of Nant Gwryd) and notably the site of an historic Roman marching camp. 
# That it is famous for the '''Pen-y-Gwryd Hotel''' which is in reality a quite ordinary Welsh country inn made famous by the people who stayed there not because of what it is but of where it is (the photo of the hotel was mine).
# That the place is well known by that name as a starting point of or staging post on a number of walking routes in Snowdonia.

I am delighted that the hotel aspect has been expanded significantly by one well qualified to do so, indeed I feel he could well expand it with advantage even further.  But I am disturbed that he is trying to turn the article into one referring only to the hotel.  The point I wish to preserve is that Pen-y-Gwryd existed as a place, which could be called by that name and recognised as such long before the farmhouse (that subsequently became the inn that was later called the Pen-y-Gwryd Hotel) was built. Indeed, the place would still bear that name even if the proprietors at some time decided (as I know they are quite free to do) to give their hotel an entirely different name.  

I would ask that the article be returned to the balanced form that it had immediately before the changes of today. [[User:NoelWalley|NoelWalley]] 19:20, 26 January 2007 (UTC)


The name &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd&quot; is synonymous with the Hotel (see current OS reference as one example, I have one from 1955 with the same information). 

The problem and it is this, its like the name &quot;Nant Gynant&quot; being synonymous with &quot;Gwynant Pass&quot; or valley, [[Nant Gwynant]] does not translate to &quot;Gwynant Pass&quot;, which the Pen-y-Gwryd overlooks.  Nant Gwynant (River or brook Gwynant) is a small stretch of river further down the valley, in Welsh strictly speaking it, the valley, should be something like &quot;Dyffryn Gwynant&quot;.  Can't have it both ways. The Hotel could clearly, given the translation of &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd&quot;, be called &quot;Pen-y-Cynnyd&quot; since that river starts there also.

Having lived in site of the Hotel beginning in 1957, (See [[Dyffryn Mymbyr]]) we  never used the name &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd&quot; as  going to the &quot;Top&quot; or &quot;Head of the Gwryd&quot; (the river Gwryd, nantygwryd) it has always mean't the hotel, &quot;The Gwryd&quot; is another term used by the locals for the place.

Walkers and so forth would use OS maps and the like to get to the hotel parking, where it states &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd Hotel&quot; and &quot;Roman camp&quot;.  Either side there are references to Nantycynnyd and Nantygwryd they are both rivers.   The car park by the road is not even on the NantyGwryd side of the saddle, its on the Nantycynnyd side.

The Hotel is far from ordinary and has writeups from all over the world (search on Google), eccentric possibly, but quite different from all other hotels in the area, anyone visiting the hotel/pub/bar or having dinner there would quickly realize.

The roman camp is interesting, but I don't think the Romans would have called their camp &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd&quot;.

IMPORTANT: An understanding of what the Welsh words mean, and what they relate to is pivotal.  Perhaps a little more research of the word Gwryd would shed some light. Pen y Gwryd just means, the TOP or HEAD of the river Gwryd (Nantygwryd), which is fed by Lockwoods lake! soem way off (which is not named on the map), which probably should have the Welsh name &quot;Llyn Gwryd&quot; but there is no reference to that, which is sad as the Welsh name sounds better and more apt. The location of Pen-y-Gwryd may well be a watershed, but Pen-y-Gwryd does not mean that at all.

Your photo is a good one, but it serves as testimony to the only named structure &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd&quot; at the location at the watershed, as said Pen-y-Gwryd (Top of the River Gwryd) is actually some way off down Dyffryn Mymbyr on the other side of the lake.  I am happy to make up an illustration from an OS map and circle the relevant objects.

Again I apologize for the way I write, I mean no offence, but I've been digging up my Septic tank for two days.

So I would be oppose to the motion for many reasons.([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 05:50, 27 January 2007 (UTC))



::I wish I could see the problem. I only ask that the first paragraph establish, as is quite proper, Pen-y-Gwyrd as a location, a place in Wales with an historic Roman Marching Camp of archaeological importance '''and''' a Victorian hotel, if indeed there is nothing else of merit there (which could be disputed). Why have you reverted me twice?

::The marching camp is not part of the hotel but is always said to be at Pen-y-Gwyrd. So too the road junction. I established this over seven months ago and four months before your first edit of this site. The Pen-y-Gwryd bus stop (its in the timetable) is not outside the hotel. Pen-y-Gwyrd is one end of a Turnpike road re-built in 1805 from Capel Curig to Pen-y-Gwyrd. That is six years before the farmhouse and over 40 years before the Inn that later became the hotel.

::I too love the hotel and its food and its traditional charm and above all it mountaineering connections and you have written about that very well.

::This is not a matter of semantics, its a matter of geography. Pen-y-Gwryd was there before the hotel. That fact detracts not one jot from the hotel - rather it enhances it. [[User:NoelWalley|NoelWalley]] 16:23, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Since Gowron has resumed editing (excellent work on the Roman Camp) without further consideration of my claim, I have entered the prior date of the turnpike and re-established the article as one concerned with the locality not just a rather famous hotel. [[User:NoelWalley|NoelWalley]] 12:06, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Don't get me wrong I like tha way you write, the problem is that you are introducing a POV, there is nothing on current maps to support what your point of view. What we have to do is state what is there and back that up.  As stated Pen-y-Gwryd in not at that site you claim it about 300 yards away on the oterh side of the lake. As also stated the saddle is at the head of two river or brooks both couls quite happily claim the name to the location depending on which way you are look at it, i.e. from the Gwynant Valley or from Dyffryn Mymbyr.

If you actually went to Pen-y-Gwryd you would be standing in a few feet of water.

Pen-y-Pass is designated on the map, Pen-y-Gwryd is not, and for good reason.

If you have mapped evidence to support you Point Of View (I'm not fond of POV, but there it is) then post it and we will go quite.  Remember also Bronze Age People who lived in the area before the Celt would not have used Pen-y-Gwryd,  and neither would the Romans.  So the your point is pretty much unsustabtiated. So I'm going to have to revert for the moment.  May be we could enlist the help of other experts, or even ask Ordanace Survey for an answer, I am prepared to do that. 

I think I've given a much fuller and longer responce to all points based on what we can read. {[[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 12:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC))

::Would you like me to conact Ordanace Survery fo clarification?.  I'm going to have to leave Wikiperdia alone for a short while, I have two work related projects to finish. Cheers  ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 12:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC))

==Origins of the name==
I have seen the recent debate (above), but have been so busy this last week that I was unable to join in.  I see that the intro has been changed again since I last looked, but here's my tuppence worth ....

No official map that I know of labels the location as Pen-y-gwryd, but the hotel is always named.  Having said that, the area clearly has a significance going back many centuries, and the Roman camp aside, it was for a long time an important junction of routes.  As such, it must surely have had a name, but unless someone can provide an old map (or other evidence) pre-dating the hotel, this might remain a mystery.

That said, I've just found a paragraph in ''The Mountains of Snowdonia'' (by Carr &amp; Lister, 1925) regarding the name.  I quote verbatim :

{{cquote|
Pen-y-Gwryd is a name of innocent appearance, but bristling with difficulties. It might be supposed to mean the head of Nant y Gwryd - the valley of the river Gwryd.  But the name of the river is Mymbyr. '' [my note: maps I have seen both before and after the date of this book show it as Nantygwryd or Nant Gwryd.]''

D.E. Jenkins [author of ''Beddgelert, its Facts, Fairies and Folklore'', 1899] speaks of a tradition that it receives its name from one Gwryd, who, according to the ''Verses of the Graves'', is buried in the valley. There are two persons of the name mentioned in the Verses, but in neither case is this valley clearly indicated.  Moreover, the article seems out of place, and we should expect to get &quot;Nant Gwryd&quot; simply, whereas as far back as the twelfth century the word &quot;Chwmygoret&quot; appears in the Aberconwy Charter. In addition to the farmland of Cwm y Gwryd, the charter refers to &quot;kemen trinemt, and gwryt, kei, on either side of the Degymm&quot;. ''Kemen trinemt'' is rendered by Jenkins &quot;Cefn Trawsnant&quot;, and ''gwryt kei'' &quot;Cae Gwryd&quot;.  The Degymm, which he suggests is Daugwm, seems at first sight to be the stream running south from Pen-y-Gwryd to join the Afon Trawsnant.  But the word ''Kemen'' may stand for cymau, the old plural of cwm, in which case the Degymm may signify the ridge between the two cwms, and Cwm y Gwryd would be contained within the triangle Bwlch y Gwyddel - Pen-y-Gwryd - Pont Goleugoed.

The word gwryd means a man's length, or fathom, but is also used to mean manliness, or valour, and Rhys makes a long shot and suggests that &quot;gwryt kei&quot; commemorates some valorous feat on the part of the famous Kei, who figures so prominently in Arthurian legend.  The eastern boundary of the monk's land ran up the Nant y Llys, the name of which suggests a palace of some sort in the neighbourhood of Pen-y-Gwryd.}}

All the above aside, we have to agree that neither the hotel nor the immediate area around it is actually the &quot;Head of the Gwryd (river)&quot;.  However, this area _is_ the &quot;head of the Gwryd (valley)&quot;. Because so many place names (and their meanings) have changed over time, and on top of this there is colloquial usage, we could argue things like this for a long time. 

I'm sure that some of the above quote could be incorporated into the Wikipedia article, but one thing is certain, namely that whilst the Pen-y-gwryd _is_ a hotel, the name is also synonymous with the place.  I have literally dozens of books, both old and modern, walking books and history books, which refer to Pen-y-gwryd (as opposed to _the_ Pen-y-gwryd [hotel]) as a location. (Note that the above quote does so too.) 

I don't have time currently to edit the article.  But given the evidence, I leave it up to you as to whether PYG is a hotel, the name of which is now used to indicate the area, or whether PYG is the area, which has given its name to the hotel.

::That was a quick piece of research, well done. Does anybody think it would a good idea to meet at PYG and have a pint and chat about it (when its dry, yes you may laugh), if not the beer would go down well all the same.  I have written to both the Ordnance Survey as to why they don't label the location ,  I've also written to Gwynedd County Council to see if there are historical records that they have that may help also. One thing I probably ought to clear up is that, when I refer to &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd Hotel&quot;, I'm refering to the only building that is there bearing that name, it could just as easily be &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd Chapel&quot; (if there was one, there currently is one but I don't know how old), i.e. what I mean is the structure(s) that exist there not specifically a Hotel (which just happens to be there). I've also made an attempt to translate the words.  Would be nice to get some closure, someday. ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 20:04, 28 January 2007 (UTC))

==Some Research==

1. I've contacted Ordnance Survey with the above question regarding Pen-y-Gwryd they replied with the following:

&quot;Unfortunately we are unable to say exactly where the head of the river is. Further more all information on names of places and lakes comes from the local authority.&quot; They do not use &quot;Gwryd Valley&quot; they only have information regarding the river NantyGwryd.

2. I also contacted Gwynedd Council's archive section, even given the preliminary nature of my request they replied:

There were no references in the county place names index to &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd&quot;, it does mean the &quot;head, source or top&quot; of the Nantygwryd and that would have its source at Llyn Cym-ffynnon as the river goes no where near the Hotel.  There is a stream which has been created for the use of the Hotel which flows into Llyn Lockwood (apparently), that location is not the head of the NantyGwryd. 

The council's early maps do not show a Gwryd/Gwrhyd Valley, the river NantyGwryd is within &quot;Dyffryn Mymbyr&quot; Vale or Valley of Mymbyr.  Ther are references to &quot;Dyffryn&quot;, &quot;Dyffryn Mymbyr as a farm and also a Turnpike.  I'm off to get copies of these maps and early texts on the subject, mostly just for my own interest as they might shed light on other related issues to do with Capel Curig and onto Ogwen.

The archive people did give me a lot of suggestions and other places to look, the problem is I live in Scotland and don't get back to North Wales much and cannot physically go into the archive.

Bellow is a snippet of an early map of the area in question, its alow resolution map of the area in the 1800s that can be found on the internet. The map seems to support the council's comments.  &quot;Pont-y-Gwrhyd&quot; (the Gwryd Bridge) crosses the road some way off down the valley, also suggesting that Nantygwryd does not start at Llyn Lockwood but at Llyn Cwn-ffynnon.

::'''Observations'''

::The above map cannot be earlier than c1847 and probably much later since the property is described as a hotel.

::We are writing about Pen-y-Gwryd not Nantygwryd and so the location of the start of the river is not too important in this. The name however is used not only by a hotel and a farmhouse before it but also as the name for a mountain pass and there is evidence for this. By your reasoning, if the pass cannot be called Pen-y-Gwryd then neither can the hotel.

::The National Screen &amp; Sound Archive of Wales is quite clear the name applies
:: 1. to the mountain pass and 
:: 2. with the suffix hotel to that property. See:
:: http://screenandsound.llgc.org.uk/cronfa/place.php?place=752

That PYG is a place as well as a hotel only enhances the hotel's name. It is the hotel of this place and named after it.  The alternative is to assume that the original proprietor either invented the name or named it, like so many hotels after some place elsewhere that they liked.

::You seem to be deliberately avoiding Gwynedd County Archive information or most things you don't agree with, i.e  I don't not seek to &quot;highjack&quot; the article, I'm  presenting DATA and  NOT POV.  I not sure you understand where and what Pen-y-Gwryd is and why it is important. Yes you have a point of view, but we are not permitted POV.  I have no real problem with PASS although its not much of one, but the location of Pen-y-Gwryd in actually is not there as stated by Gwynedd County Council. The only thing there are buildings with that name, once gone there would be no name on the map at all at that spot. I could just as easily name my house  Pen-y-Gwryd, but like the hotel it would not relate too the name and thats all it is.  I'm not concerned with the hotel but structures, as just as every map states are buildings with that name.   I have not finished by far with reading on this subject, so there will be more to come. ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 16:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC))

:::I am not avoiding anything.  I have presented additional evidence.  In the matter of POV, we are required to present a neutral point of view, one that is comprehensive not narrow. To say that Pen-y-Gwryd is the name of a hotel and only that is a very narrow POV when evidence indicates otherwise. A Welsh gazetteer says it is a 'bwlch/pass' (of course it is not a major pass).  The Roman Marching Camp has no other name or address (of course it is not a major camp). Even the Gwynedd Council bus stop with its own lay-by is called Pen-y-Gwryd with no mention of hotel.

::I present facts only and what you are saying is not strictly supportable.

:I have a very dear friend learned in Welsh (I am not) who took his School Certificate exams in 1937, earlier than I did, and he writes as follows:

:::I have a little book by Dr Ifor Williams called 'Enwau Lleol' Place Names in English.  He examined me in about 1937 for my Welsh Oral at O level. He was a lovely man and put me immediately at my ease. He was also erudite as I think I will now show.  He refers to a Charter of Llewelyn the Great to the Monastery at Maenan, in 1240.  In the charter come the words 'Gwryt Kei' Kei was the chief officer at the court of Arthur.  The meaning of the word 'gwryd' is the same as 'fathom' in English. The measurement is the distance between a man's finger tips when his arms are outstretched on both side of his body.  One must suppose that gwryd would in ancient times be the area that a Lord could command or if he was a giant!!.  It would seem that gwryd is an area of land and not a fixed point.

::In support of his theory he quotes from a couplet by Iean Brydydd Hir and I write in Welsh so that you can see the use of the word gwryd.
:::::Y Gwr a roes y gwryd,
:::::Ar y groes dros bumoes byd.

::::He refers to Christ upon the Cross with arms outstretched for all mankind. He has some other references too but it would seem that this word goes much further back in time than any of us could have imagined.

::With thanks to my learned friend, I submit that Pen-y-gwyrd is a place, at the head of a pass, with a road junction and a Roman camp and a very fine hotel. [[User:NoelWalley|NoelWalley]] 14:54, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

: The Street Map feature is most interesting but I think somebody should tell them that the arrow pointing to:   
'''Pen-y-Gwryd Hotel, Gwynedd''' 
actually points beyond the Roman Camp in quite the opposite direction to either hotel or camp.
and also the arrow pointing to: 
'''Pen-y-Gwryd Hotel, Gwynedd [Other Named Place]'''
actually sits on top of the hotel name and points away from both hotel and Roman Camp.   [[User:NoelWalley|NoelWalley]] 20:55, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

==The name Pen-y-Gwryd==
Gwynedd Council in a Public Roadworks Bulletin dated 27 November 2006 give the following address for temporary traffic lights in connection with bridge strengthening works:
A498 Pont Pen-y-Gwryd, Pen-y-Gwryd, Beddgelert.

http://209.85.135.104/search?q=cache:cozgbF4qGecJ:www.gwynedd.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/862/Roadworks_bulletin_27th_November_2006_2.pdf+A498+road+pen+y+gwryd&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=20&amp;gl=uk

Conwy Council in its published minutes of the Winter road gritting schedules list the following length (which actually goes beyond the Conwy boundary and the hotel to the A498 junction):

Left onto A4086 Capel Curig to Penygwryd Jct A498. 
Turn around and free travel back to Jct A5 Capel Curig. 

http://209.85.135.104/search?q=cache:FVColgkdT9MJ:www.conwy.gov.uk/E_MINUTES/e_post2002/e_cabinet/e_reports/04Winter%2520Maintenance%2520Policy.pdf+A498+road+pen+y+gwryd&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=40&amp;gl=uk

These together with the Roman Camp and other evidence above provide adequate proof that the name is not restricted to the hotel but is used officially as a location name and it would be incorrect for the Wikipedia article to restrict the name to the hotel.[[User:NoelWalley|NoelWalley]] 22:17, 10 February 2007 (UTC)


Noel, please don't missunderstand I'm trying to be reasonable and I think its important to say that i appreciate YOU, but buss stops, gritting lorries don't carry much weight with regards to 2000 and latter 200 years of history of the area. I also have both and A and B versions of the old poem (Speculum Vol 13 No. 1 Jan 1938 pp. 38-51, written by Mary Williams), the only thing that has any relevance or makes any sense is &quot;I would wade a ford&quot; in reference to Gwryd in version A  (Wynnstay, I, 91 Melwas).  Ford on Welsh translates to &quot;Rhyd&quot;. The river was not named Gwryd as is born out by Llewelyn's charter.  The river was named Mymbyr! atthat time and starts at Llyn Cwnffynnon and hence as a result there is no valley name Gwryd, even a river?, but just possibly here is a ford where people crossed, somewhere below Pont-y-Gwrhyd where a bridge did not initialy exist. Writers often describe how difficult the terain was in the 1750's onwards. Other than that what you personnaly state has very little bearing. I will not overwrite the the initial paragraph, I will keep applying weight to the facts (the name, the hotel, the geography, its historical fact.  There is a lot more literary gravitas to be added, but even though I was brought up in the valley, and know the people at either end of the valley . . . . it surely must count for something?. ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 00:00, 21 February 2007 (UTC))

::Robin, My concern and that of others is that the name has a wider meaning applicable to the locality not just to the hotel and that is satisfied by the first paragraph and by the Roman Camp paragraph. I certainly do not wish to mention bus stops or gritting lorries in the article. I mention them in the discussion (as surely is obvious) to show that the name is used locally and in local authority minutes and public notices to indicate the locality as well as the hotel. 

::You continue to add interesting material and pictures. Did Joseph Grifith spell his name thus? Why do you add [[Description]] before your captions? Best wishes [[User:NoelWalley|NoelWalley]] 08:37, 21 February 2007 (UTC).

::Morning Noel, its busy here, I've taken on too much work (self emp-loyed). I'm so glad we have both calmed a little on this.  I underatand what it is you are trying to get accross (and I suppose if I'm really honest with myself I'm not really against it), what I am interested in is  whether  it is accurate with regard to the name &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd&quot; &quot;what it is&quot;/&quot;where it is&quot;  and the history ( the name Gwryd or Gw-rhyd is a relatively late addition to the area).  I have enjoyed doing some reading, the &quot;The Mountains of Snowdonia&quot; is a MUST have, just for the read alone, if I had the mnoney I would send you one but they can fetch £70 plus.  Suffice to say you have informatin regarding Gwynedd minutes, my guess is thats just a way of dealing with describing what goes on there.  But historicaly, and I'll continue to check with the University of Cardiff (who did a study on Pen-y-Gwryd) and I'll contact Jane Pullee for their take as well.  Another book of note is by &quot;Thomas Pennant&quot; but I don't have a copy at this time.

::To crystalize my point, is that there is no marked place &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd&quot; or &quot;Gwrhyd&quot;, &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd&quot; means the top of the Nantygwryd river (there is no Gwryd Valley the entire valley is Dyffryn Mymbyr as the river (now Nantygwryd) was called originally Mymbyr which starts at Llyn Cwmffynnon (Llewelyn's charter), also Esmie Firbanks/Kirby's house is called &quot;Dyffryn Mymbyr&quot; which is towards the middle of the Nantygwryd, the house dates back to [[1350]], suggesting some later intervention in that location. Given these data, and a host of others, it is probably safe to state that it is the longevity and fame of the Hotel and its guests (and their writings) that has brought about the situation where &quot;Pen-y-Gwryd&quot; is used by itself without refering to the hotel, i.e. the hotel (or as I would prefer &quot;entity&quot;) has become the donator of the name to the location. 

::The name &quot;Joseph Grifith&quot; came out of &quot;A short History of The Royal Hotel&quot; produced by &quot;the Royal Hotel&quot;, its a small booklet and I am premitted to scan pieces of it since its over a 100 years old and send these on if you would like some of it. 

::The [[Description]] tag is there purely as some Wiki users have used it and I've just copied the template, no  great thought has gone into it,  I'll stop if its annoying.

:: Thanks for the typo corrections, it is irritating to find them, I would if possible like to put back the 3 photos of the [[Everest]] and [[Kangchenjunga]] into the relevant section, i.e where the text relating to them is in the article, it was Stemonitis's idea and I quite liked it as it was functional. I can experiment with the spacing. Anyway thanks for the corrections and best regards. ([[User:Gowron|Gowron]] 11:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC))

These days, I haven't been as interested in Wikipedia, but I still edit, once something on my watchlist gets edited...

I am one of the most private users on Wikipedia. All the &quot;private&quot; information I'll give out to you is that I'm one of the 200 million people who live in the eastern U.S. Bet you can't find me!

However, I will tell you what I do on Wikipedia.
 
==What I do on Wikipedia==
Besides vandal reverting (which I do a LOT of), I write about roller coasters and cattle. I also participate in AfD discussions and the like. I have over 1000 edits.

*2/20/06:  First edit as an anon
*3/14/06:  First vandal reversion as an anon
*3/19/06:  First edit as SupaStarGirl
*4/10/06:  First article created
*4/11/06:  First pagemove
*4/25/06:  First vandal reversion as SupaStarGirl
*9/29/06:  500th edit as SupaStarGirl
*10/26/06:  The day when my userpage was vandalized 40 times. I should have warned him instead of staying on my userpage and reverting him.
*12/16/06:  1000th edit as SupaStarGirl.  In fact, the 1000th edit was the addition of these sentences to my userpage!

==My opinion of Wikipedia==
I'll also tell you my opinion of Wikipedia. Fun site to edit! However, it is not as reliable as Encyclopaedia Britannica, and an OK source. Format and grammar errors are more common than content errors, and a LOT more common than vandalism and hoax (fake) articles. The reason why I've found all the vandalism is because I've been looking for it by clicking the &quot;Recent changes&quot; link at left. Wikipedia is more reliable than SuspiciousBlogSite.com, but less reliable than RespectableEncyclopedia.com. If you see a suspicious article, don't trust it, or, if you want, edit it!

I've been to the site and seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. The most reliable articles are the articles that lots of people visit (at least when they are not vandalism, because they get a lot of vandalism as well!). The least reliable articles are those that are in really bad format that have only a couple of contributors in the edit history.

==My articles==
I have created many articles on the English Wikipedia. [[Jr. Gemini]], [[Woodstock Express]], [[Braford]], [[Maine-Anjou]], and [[Wikipedia:Edits with silly edit summaries]]. The edit summary article was part of a series of pages of funny vandalism called [[Wikipedia:Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense|Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense]] (which someone else created). It was deleted because it wasn't as funny as the others. I agree with them! :-(

==Userboxes==
{{User:SupaStarGirl/Userboxes}}















==One last note==
This page has been tested or vandalized many times. The worst one was an anon IP that inserted some really gross text FOURTY times in a row! If you want to test out Wikipedia, use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]] instead. If you want to insert nonsense, go to [[User:SupaStarGirl/Vandalbox]].

'''Francisco Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Roxo''' (1933–1976) was a Portuguese hunter, safari guide, and soldier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune 1986&quot;/&gt; Born in [[Mogadouro]], he emigrated to [[Niassa Province]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]] during the 1950s, where he established himself as a professional hunter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune 1986&quot;/&gt; Roxo later fought in the [[Mozambican War of Independence]] against nationalist guerrillas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune 1986&quot;/&gt; After Mozambican independence he served as a foreign volunteer in [[32 Battalion (South Africa)|32 Battalion]], a Portuguese-speaking unit of the South African Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rip&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sadf.sentinelprojects.com/sasfl/operator.html |title=In Memory of three Special Forces and 32 Battalion Soldiers |publisher=Senteniel Projects |year=2005 |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life==
Daniel Roxo was born in [[Mogadouro]], [[Trás-os-Montes Province|Trás-os-Montes]], on 1 February 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rip&quot;/&gt; As a young man he immigrated to [[Niassa Province]] in 1951, where he settled as a professional hunter and safari guide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rip&quot;/&gt; When the [[Mozambican War of Independence]] broke out in 1964 Roxo formed his African trackers, servants, and European acquaintances into a private militia, hunting FRELIMO combatants for government bounties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nortje-86&quot;/&gt;

Disillusioned by Portugal's promise to hand Mozambique to [[Samora Machel]]'s incoming government, Roxo supported an abortive coup d'état by anti-FRELIMO forces in [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]] on September 7, 1974. He went into exile in South Africa the following November, joining the [[South African Defence Force]]. After completing Special Forces selection, Danny was seconded to Bravo Group (later [[32 Battalion (South Africa)|32 Battalion]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nortje-86&quot;/&gt;

==South African military career==

===Operation Savannah===
Roxo was awarded the [[Honoris Crux (1975)|Honoris Crux]] for bravery during [[Operation Savannah (Angola)|Operation Savannah]] for an action during the [[Operation Savannah (Angola)#&quot;Bridge 14&quot;|Battle of Bridge 14]] at {{Coord|-11.05| 15.0822|name=Bridge 14}}, an engagement during which he single-handedly killed eleven enemy soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nortje-86&quot;/&gt;

Bridge 14 was situated on the Nhia River, en route from [[Cela, Angola|Cela]] to [[Quibala]]. South African mechanized contingents deploying to the south had routed a unit of the [[People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA) some time prior, and the retreating Angolans had demolished the existing structure. However, since Colonel [[Jan Breytenbach]] could not ascertain this from his forward positions, he ordered Roxo to conduct a more thorough reconnaissance.&lt;ref name=&quot;B14&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodesia.nl/bridge14.htm |title=The Battle of Bridge 14 |publisher=rhodesia.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roxo arrived at the river with four [[Eland Mk7|Eland-90]] armoured cars; his patrol came under heavy mortar fire from an opposite bank and two of the vehicles withdrew, leaving Roxo's platoon to retire on foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nortje-86&quot;/&gt; Having scouted the bridge alone and determined it was no longer intact, he inadvertently walked into an FAPLA ambush, but he managed to dispatch his attackers. Two escaped South African prisoners later claimed that aside from the Angolan casualties, four Cuban troops were reported killed in the encounter.&lt;ref name=&quot;B14&quot;/&gt;

===Death===
During a patrol near the Okavango river, his personnel carrier struck a landmine and overturned, killing one man and crushing Roxo beneath it. The rest of the vehicle's crew tried to lift it free, but it was too heavy. Breytenbach wrote:

:&quot;Roxo, in keeping with his dauntless character, decided to make the best of things, lighting a cigarette and smoking it calmly until it was finished, then he died - still pinned beneath the Wolf. He had not complained once, nor uttered a single groan or moan, although the pain must have been excruciating.&quot;

== Verkade ==

I found this page after doing some research into the topic of fair trade and bean-to-bar chocolate, however, I noticed that there is atleast one mistake. Namely that Verkade is not a bean-to-bar producer. Their chocolate does have the UTZ certification but that is about it. I tried to check, but could not find anything that points to Verkade using bean-to-bar production. Since this article is semi protected and I can't change it myself, I thought of dropping a line here. Hope this works.  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mr Begeer|Mr Begeer]] ([[User talk:Mr Begeer#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mr Begeer|contribs]]) 14:08, 14 April 2017 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

&lt;center&gt;==WikiProjects==
Yes, I take part in many WikiProjects. Unfortunately, I can only be somewhat active in any of them, as there are only about 24 hours in any given Earth 'day.' However, I am as active as I can be.

These are the WikiProjects I am currently taking part in:

*[[WP:WPME|Middle Earth]]

&lt;center&gt;==More Information==
Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia, specifically my userpage. I am a relatively infrequent editor on Wikipedia, only editing articles that I possess personal knowlege of or have an interest in.

Some of my work on Wikipedia involves patrolling [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent Changes]] for vandalism nowadays. The rest either involves improving pages under the jurisdiction of one of my [[Wikipedia:Wikiprojects|WikiProjects]] or just editing where I see fit.

Please feel free to leave a note on my talk page for any reason. Have a nice day!

IMHO the articles about the building ([[Hôtel-Dieu, Beaune]]) and about the charitable institution ([[Hospices de Beaune]]) should be merged. Best wishes, --[[User:Drahreg01|Drahreg01]] 19:50, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Oppose''' - the two are really quite separate subjects. --[[User:Ross Burgess|rossb]] 22:48, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Support''' I know this is old but the two really should be merged, the far more comprehensive French version treats them as one subject and the Hôtel-Dieu is the hospice. The opening line of the French article even states it as &quot;Les Hospices de Beaune ou Hôtel-Dieu de Beaune est un ancien établissement hospitalier du XVe siècle, devenu aujourd'hui musée, situé à Beaune en Bourgogne.&quot; [[User:Jayran|Jayran]] 05:36, 6 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''day-fine''', '''day fine''', '''unit fine''' or '''structured fine''' is a unit of [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] payment that, above a minimum fine, is based on the offender's daily [[personal income]]. A crime is punished with incarceration for a determined number of days, or with fines. As incarceration is a financial [[punishment]], in the effect of preventing work, a day-fine represents one day incarcerated and without salary. It is argued to be just, because if both high-income and low-income population are punished with the same jail time, they should also be punished with a proportionally similar income loss. An analogy may be drawn with [[income tax]], which is also proportional to the income, even [[progressive tax|progressively]].

Jurisdictions employing the day-fine include Finland ({{lang-fi|päiväsakko}}), Sweden ({{lang-sv|dagsbot}}), Denmark ({{lang-da|dagbøde}}), Croatia, Germany ({{lang-de|Tagessatz}}), Switzerland,  and Macao.

==Distribution==
Unit fine systems are common and standard in many jurisdictions across the world, notably in [[Fenno-Scandinavia]], where it originated in 1921 in [[Finland]], and in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

===Finland===
[[Image:Poliiseja ja rajavartijoita partioveneellä.jpg|thumb|right|Both police and the [[Finnish Border Guard]] can make a formal demand for fining a person or order a petty fine.]]
In [[Finland]], the day-fine system is used for most crimes that are punishable by way of a fine. The system has been in use since 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Law 130/1921&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Suzanne Daley]]  |agency= |title=Speeding in Finland Can Cost a Fortune, if You Already Have One |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/world/europe/speeding-in-finland-can-cost-a-fortune-if-you-already-have-one.html |quote=In fact, the Finnish “day fine” system, also in use in some other Scandinavian countries, dates to the 1920s, when fines based on income were instituted for all manner of lesser crimes, such as petty theft and assault, and helped greatly reduce the prison population. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=April 25, 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most minor infractions are punished with a fixed petty fine (''rikesakko'', ''ordningsbot'') such as minor traffic and water traffic violations,
[[litter]]ing, and breaches of public peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 Criminal Code (''Rikoslaki'' 39/1889)] Chapter 2a, 9 §] Retrieved 9-27-2007 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A petty fine is summarily ordered by the police officer if the suspect does not contest his guilt, but the person punished may contest the fine in a district court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1983/19830066 ''Laki rikesakkomenettelystä'', 6§ and 12 §.] Retrieved 9-27-2007 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Valtionsyyttäjä Ari Kuusimäki ja kihlakunnansyyttäjät Johanna Hervonen sekä Tommi Hietanen.jpg|thumb|right|Finnish prosecutors have considerable judicial power in deciding fines. Here, prosecutors are arriving at a court of law.]]
Most infractions are punishable with a day-fine. For crimes warranting no more than six months in prison, the fine may be summarily ordered by the [[prosecutor]] if the suspect does not want the court to handle the case. The process of ordering a day fine is started by a police officer who makes a formal demand for the suspect to be fined. The suspect has one week to contest the demand. If the suspect does not contest the demand, the prosecutor may order a fine which may not be higher than demanded by the police officer. If the suspect contests the demand, the case may be taken to the [[Judicial system of Finland#District Courts|district court]] if the prosecutor considers the suspect guilty. If the prosecutor considers the case to merit a term in prison or a higher fine, the case is always taken to the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1993/19930692 ''Laki rangaistusmääräysmenettelystä'' (692/1992)] Retrieved 9-27-2007 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the prosecution or the injured party do not demand a higher punishment than a fine, the district court has a [[quorum]] with a single member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1734/17340004000 ''Oikeudenkäymiskaari'' (4/1734)], Chapter 2, 6 §. Retrieved 9-27-2007. {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fine is paid to the bank using a [[giro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oikeus.fi/oikeusrekisterikeskus/13536.htm Oikeusrekisterikeskus. ''Täytäntöönpano- ja perintäasiat'']. Retrieved 9-27-2007. {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fine ordered in Finland is executable in any [[European Union]] member country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oikeus.fi/oikeusrekisterikeskus/39018.htm Oikeusrekisterikeskus. ''EU-sakkojen täytäntöönpano'']. Retrieved 9-27-2007. {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Finnish fine consists of a minimum of 1 day-fine, up to a maximum of 120 day-fines. If several crimes are punished together, 240 day-fines may be sentenced. The fines may not be sentenced together with a prison sentence, unless the prison sentence is probational. The minimum amount of a day-fine is 6 [[euro]]s. Usually, the day-fine is one half of daily disposable income. The daily disposable income is considered to be one 60th part of the person's monthly mean income during the year, after taxes, social security payments and a basic living allowance of €255 per month have been deducted. In addition, every person for whose upkeep the fined person is responsible decreases the amount of daily fine by €3. The income of the person is calculated on the basis of the latest taxation data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 ''Rikoslaki'' (39/1889), Chapter 2a]. Retrieved 27-9-2007 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1999/19990609 ''Asetus päiväsakon rahamäärästä''], 2-3§. Retrieved 27-9-2007. {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For speeding in traffic, however, the fine is at least as high as the petty fine, i.e. €115.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2001/20011037 ''Asetus päiväsakon rahamäärästä''], 7§. Retrieved 27-9-2007. {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person who is punished with a fine is responsible for giving accurate information concerning their income. Lying about one's income ({{lang-fi|sakkovilppi}}, {{lang-sv|bötesfusk}}) is a crime punishable with a fine or up to three months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 ''Rikoslaki'' (39/1889)], Chapter 16, 6 §. Retrieved 9-27-2007. {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police can, however, access the taxation data of Finnish citizens and permanent residents via a real-time datalink, so the chance of lying successfully is minor. There is no maximum day-fine, which may lead to considerably high fines for high-income persons. For example, in 2001, a Finnish businessman with a yearly income of 10 million euros, received a relatively mild punishment of six day-fines, amounting €26,000, for driving though a red traffic light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/Nokian%20Ala-Pietil%C3%A4n%20208000%20markan%20sakot%20voivat%20viel%C3%A4%20nousta/art-1288335939159.html Nokian Ala-Pietilän 208000 markan sakot voivat vielä nousta] Iltasanomat 11-9-2001.

This has given rise to some criticism, most vividly expressed by a Finnish member of parliament, avid motorist [[Klaus Bremer]] and other MPs of right-wing parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riksdagen.fi/faktatmp/utatmp/akxtmp/ptk_73_2000_ke_p_7.shtml ''Täysistunnon pöytäkirja PTK 73/2000 vp'' (The minutes of the plenary session of Finnish parliament, PTK 73/2000 vp.)] Retrieved 9-27-2007. {{fi icon}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615013709/http://www.riksdagen.fi/faktatmp/utatmp/akxtmp/ptk_73_2000_ke_p_7.shtml |date=June 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fines are subject to recovery proceedings.

===Macao===
Article 45 of the Penal Code ({{zh|刑法典}}, Portuguese: {{lang|pt|Código Penal}}) specifies that a criminal fine ({{zh|罰金}}, Portuguese: {{lang|pt|pena de multa}}) shall normally be at least 10 days and at most 360 days. One day-fine costs at least 50 [[Macanese pataca]]s and at most 10,000 patacas. A court of law imposes the fine based on the economic and financial situations and personal burdens of a convict.&lt;ref&gt;Penal Code of Macao in [http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/95/46/codpencn/codpen0001.asp traditional Chinese] and [http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/i/95/46/codpenpt/codpen0001.asp Portuguese]. Retrieved 2008-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[England and Wales]] experimented with the system for a short period from 1992 to 1993. It was unpopular with both [[magistrate]]s and the general public, and was soon abandoned.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/03/19042/34209 Summary Justice Review Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Fine plans echo 1991 Tory policy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4173913.stm |work=[[BBC]] |location=London |date=January 14, 2015 |access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was replaced by requirements that magistrates consider an offender's means when imposing a fine, just not according to a mathematical formula.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

===United States===
''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on an experience with day fines which took place in 1988 in [[Staten Island]], which was a partnership between the local courts and [[District Attorney]], and the [[Vera Institute of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Criminal Fines, by the Day |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/29/opinion/criminal-fines-by-the-day.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |date=August 29, 1988 |access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aeronautica Imperialis''''' is a [[Miniature wargaming|tabletop miniature wargame]] set within the ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' universe. The game focuses on aerial combat between the different races of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Released in January 2007, it was developed and published by [[Forge World]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Forge World 2007 Catalogue&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Forge World 2007 Catalogue|publisher=Forge World, Games Workshop|location=Nottingham|isbn=1-84154-650-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; a division of the British gaming company [[Games Workshop]].

Aeronautica Imperialis is a companion game to ''[[Epic (game)|Epic]]'', which emphasises battles between armies on a larger scale than ''Warhammer 40,000''.

==The game==
Gameplay-wise, the major difference between ''Epic'' and ''Aeronautica Imperialis'' is that instead of a player moving and firing tanks and troops, they are using aircraft and ground defense weapons.

The ''Aeronautica Imperialis'' rulebook contains not only rules for the games, but also [https://web.archive.org/web/20130109044458/http://www.forgeworld.co.uk/Epic-40000/Rule__and_Accessories/AERONAUTICA-IMPERIALIS-COMBAT-MANOEUVRE-CARDS.html two sheets of cards] which are used to make special manoeuvres. Other content in the rulebook is background material on the individual aircraft, along with full colour plates and suggestions for painting. At the end of the book, there is a 'campaign' section with scenarios for players to recreate.

==Armies and Units==

It makes use of currently available aircraft models designed for ''[[Epic (game)|Epic]]'', which are approximately [[Scale model#Model tanks and wargaming|6mm scale, or 1:285]]. Forge World's [https://web.archive.org/web/20130116114549/http://www.forgeworld.co.uk/Epic-40000 Epic web pages] say that &quot;Epic models are 5 times smaller than their Warhammer 40,000 equivalent&quot;. In addition to the use of the miniatures, Forge World also sells special bases for the game to indicate such things as the [[Altitude#Altitude in Aviation|altitude]], [[Airspeed|speed]], and fire arcs of each aeroplane.

The currently supported races or factions are the [[Imperial Navy (Warhammer 40,000)|Imperial Navy]], [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]], [[Eldar (Warhammer 40,000)|Eldar]], [[Tau (Warhammer 40,000)|Tau]], [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]] and [[Ork (Warhammer 40,000)|Orks]].

==Storylines==

Aeronautica Imperialis has a strong tie with the [[Black Library]] book ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183846/http://www.blacklibrary.co.uk/product.asp?prod=60100199064&amp;type=Book Double Eagle]'' by [[Dan Abnett]]. This deals with the air war occurring during the [[Sabbat Worlds Campaign]] (the setting for Abnett's ''[[Gaunt's Ghosts]]'' novel series). It has a [[Battle of Britain]] flavour; many of the concepts elucidated in the Aeronautica rules can be seen in Abnett's writing.

==Supplements==
In late 2007, Forge World released [https://web.archive.org/web/20130109041807/http://www.forgeworld.co.uk/Epic-40000/Rule__and_Accessories/TACTICA-AERONAUTICA.html Tactica Aeronautica], a collection of extra rules, new aircraft and scenarios for the game.

Originally written for video games and movies, the Technetium music experience is now expanding to clubs and fans around the world. With Technetium's signature sonic assault on the senses, each track promises to take us to where the 'Wild Things' are!

I've had a message about the photo which includes lads you suggested at [[Talk:Ned (Scottish)]] you're acquainted with. It may be a hoax, but if you think one or more of them would like the picture removed, it's not a big issue and I'm happy to do that. ..[[User:Dave souza|dave souza]], [[User talk:Dave souza|talk]] 19:51, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Untitled==
I'm going to remove &quot;Chelsea is the smallest city in the United States. It is just 1.8 square miles.&quot;
Reason: Central Falls, RI is 1.3 1.3 mi² ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Falls ) , and I am not sure that Central Falls is the smallest

== History ==

{{contradict}}
How could Chelsea have been part of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in its first few years if Boston did not exist until 1630? -- [[User:Beland|Beland]] 01:07, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

Yo.

== 2010 Census ==

Can someone please update the demographics? [[User:DeltaRhoPhi|ΔΡΦ]] ([[User talk:DeltaRhoPhi|talk]]) 21:41, 12 December 2011 (UTC)

==Population Density==

Chelsea is only 1.8 square miles of land.  If you look at the table linked to with US city densities it uses a larger land area.  I believe Chelsea should actually be ranked 15th most dense city, not 26th.  Looking at other cities on the list (including NYC) they make this land vs land+water distinction when calculating density.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Brufleth|Brufleth]] ([[User talk:Brufleth|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Brufleth|contribs]]) 20:03, 27 April 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Elizabeth Cady Stanton ==

Elizabeth Cady Stanton (American social activist, abolitionist, and leading figure of the early women's rights movement) spent much of the 1840s in the Boston area; their home (from about 1843 to 1847) was actually not in the city of Boston, but rather in Chelsea, a city in Suffolk County directly across the Mystic River, just north of downtown Boston.

&quot;She had married Stanton on May 10, 1840, at the age of 25 and accompanied him immediately thereafter on a journey to the World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London. At the close of the convention, the Stantons traveled around the British Isles and France for several months; in November 1840, they returned to Elizabeth Cady Stanton's childhood home in Johnstown, New York, where Henry Stanton studied law for two years under his father-in-law, Judge Daniel Cady. In 1842, Henry Stanton started a law practice of his own in Boston and the family relocated to a home outside the city of Chelsea. [1]
[1. Edward T. James, Janet Wilson James, Paul S. Boyer, eds, Notable American Women, Vol. III (Massachusetts, 1971), pp. 342-3.]

Here, Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote &quot;I spent some of the happiest days of my life, enjoying, in turn, the beautiful outlook, my children, and my books.&quot; [2] [2. Stanton, Eighty Years, p. 140.] Through her husband's associations with the leading abolitionist and reform figures of the day she made the acquaintance of many of the liberal, literary, and philosophical lights then illuminating Boston. Stanton took full advantage of her stimulating situation and later wrote that &quot;I attended all the lectures, churches, theaters, concerts, and temperance, peace, and prison-reform conventions within my reach. I had never lived in such an enthusiastically literary and reform latitude before, and my mental powers were kept at the highest tension.&quot; [3] [3. Stanton, Eighty Years, p. 133.] Henry Stanton's health, however, was not up to the raw Boston winters, and after four years the decision was made to return to New York state.&quot;

==Inconsistency==

The article's history is not entirely clear; mention is made of a prior structure on the same site (by the same name?) but only the current building's history is outlined. However, despite the current building being opened in 1950, this site is noted as the home of the Quebec Bulldogs from 1910-1920. If anyone can expand on this, please feel free. [[User:Duncan1800|Duncan1800]] ([[User talk:Duncan1800|talk]]) 04:38, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

==Title / Language==

There seems to be some inconsistency in the first sentence of the article.  It says &quot;Colisée Pepsi (English: Pepsi Coliseum), formerly the Colisée de Québec (English: The Quebec Coliseum)...&quot;.  However, this is the English Wikipedia.  Thus, if the names, in English, really are/were &quot;X Coliseum&quot;, then the name of this article should be &quot;Pepsi Coliseum&quot;.  Alternately, if it's called &quot;Colisée Pepsi&quot; in English (we use all sorts of foreign-origin names in English - we don't call the Autobahn &quot;the Car Road&quot;), then the first sentence should not say (English: ) - because its name, in English, should be the title of the article already! Looking at the English version of their own website (http://www.expocite.com/www/colisee-pepsi.php), it appears that they call it the &quot;Pepsi Coliseum&quot; when they're speaking English.  That's a strong argument, but there may be other, more important sources.  If it turns out that &quot;Pepsi Coliseum&quot; is far more prevalent in English, then we should change the title of the article.  I'll do that in a few days if no one replies to this, or if there are only messages of support.  Otherwise, let's talk about it.  Cheers, [[User:AshleyMorton|AshleyMorton]] ([[User talk:AshleyMorton|talk]]) 02:29, 25 October 2011 (UTC)
* Huh - well, I placed this note here a year and a half ago, and got no response. I've done some digging, and can only come up with sources that call it the &quot;Coliseum&quot; or the &quot;Pepsi Coliseum&quot;. Lacking contradictions, let's move this to &quot;Pepsi Coliseum&quot;. [[User:AshleyMorton|AshleyMorton]] ([[User talk:AshleyMorton|talk]]) 22:31, 8 July 2013 (UTC)</text>

== Age ==

According to [[The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock &amp; Roll]] author Eric Segalstad, Leslie Harvey was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a 27.
Segalstad acquired a copy of his death certificate, and according to the date of birth on it he was actually 26.
[[User:EzraZebra|EzraZebra]] ([[User talk:EzraZebra|talk]]) 05:13, 22 February 2010 (UTC)
:If the birth and death dates in this article are accurate, he was 27. If they are inaccurate, they should be corrected. Who's got a source? [[User:Dcs002|Dcs002]] ([[User talk:Dcs002|talk]]) 02:25, 22 July 2011 (UTC)

== Cause of death ==

I have removed the excessive detail on the final paragraph. The quotation from [[Dr John]]'s book is a borderline [[WP:COPVIO|copyright violation]] and could easily be trimmed down, the detail is excessive for a neutral and balanced biography, and the specific cause of death contradicts the NME source, which reports he was electrocuted while announcing a number, not playing a song.

Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links in order to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. --&gt;

The result was  '''no consensus''', I guess. No real discussion about the deletion since the copyvio was identified. If someone writes an original article, or this one gets kept at wp:cp, feel free to nominate it again (if you feel like it). - [[User:Bobet|Bobet]] 21:23, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

===[[Natalie choquette]]===
None of the information in this article is sourced, and although there is a small claim to notability, none of it is verified.  Also note: the article's sole contributor is a possible single purpose account. [[User:MonkBirdDuke|MonkBirdDuke]] 19:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - This one's a toughie.  The artist is certainly notable per [[WP:Bio|our guidelines]], but the article seems to exist for publicity purposes (based on the prime editor's comments on the [[Talk:Natalie_choquette|talk page]]).  I'm also concerned about how closely the article resembles the artist's biography posted on her official website (the French one, I couldn't open the English version).  I would appreciate it if someone with a better command of French took a look at the two to make sure we are not stealing material.  That issue aside, we have a notable individual who's bio needs significant clean up, but not deletion.

*'''Tag as copyvio and close'''.  Notable enough, but still a copyvio so tagging it until it gets resolved.  [[User:ColourBurst|ColourBurst]] 21:03, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Pat, I've reviewed the edits and commented in detail on the RFI page.

::He seems a bit less active at the moment.  I noticed [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Punk_fashion&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=82465468 this] questionable edit yesterday, where he changed ''goth'' to ''mainstream'', but it was later deleted by another editor.  I'm still not sure what's supposed to happen on [[WP:RFI]]; it's not clear what it takes to convince an admin to become involved, and I'm not even sure what the remedy is. -- [[User:Jim Douglas|Jim Douglas]] [[User talk:Jim Douglas|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Jim Douglas|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;(contribs)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]] 15:13, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

:::Why are you hounding me, Jim Douglas?  You call the edit to which you linked 'questionable'...I corrected some shocking grammar, and changed the statement so it more accurately fits the facts.  What do you know about 'emo'?  I must confess I don't know much about it, but what I do know is enough to realise that claiming it is influenced by gothic fashion is blatantly false, and was obviously added by a misinformed imbecile who can't write a coherent sentence.  The influence on 'emo' ''must'' be mainstream fashion, because it is like a watered-down poserish form of commercialised punk. That's a fact - even those who listen to it must be aware of the poser element because they call it 'scenecore', showing that being a 'scenester' and seen as a fashionable member of the group is more important than the aesthetic merit of the music.  I am not sure that I have heard 'emo' music, but I am sure it is aesthetically bankrupt, as most of that garbage is.  The other editor probably deleted the sentence altogether because pointing out that 'emo' is mainstream is redundant.  Note that they didn't revert my edit back to 'gothic' and bad grammar, because it was the edit of ''the anonymous person'', not me, which was questionable.  So please explain exactly what is questionable about my change.  Show that I am wrong when I think you are harassing me, and trying to pick a fight by saying objectionable things about my actions.  Either that, or apologise for insulting me. [[User:The Crying Orc|The Crying Orc]] 14:03, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
::::&quot;Hounding&quot;?  Oh, please.  I made that comment to Patstuart; you had to come looking for it.  Yes, I said it was questionable; you'll also note that ''I'' didn't revert it.  The entire sentence, including your change, was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Punk_fashion&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=82465468 removed] 20 minutes later with an edit summary of &quot;deleted unneccessary and questionable content&quot;.  You've demonstrated a pattern of injecting nonsense into articles, so at the moment, your edits are questionable by default.  You have repeatedly displayed bad faith in your short time on Wikipedia.

::Actually, that edit does seem legit. Though I personally believe that emo is influenced by goth, though neither side would readily admit it (a.k.a. crossover bands like Good Charlotte, whose fashion sense is clearly gothic, but whose music is not); emo is considerably more mainstream too than goth. -[[User:Patstuart|Patstuart]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Patstuart|(talk)]][[Special:contributions/Patstuart|(contribs)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:22, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

==CC of reply==
:::Sure, no problem - and thanks for your work against vandalism. I think the reason is fairly clear. I would imagine it's someone I've written about on SourceWatch, or who represents an organisation I've written about. Since they can't identify any factual errors in those article(s), they've been unable to get the content they object to removed from SourceWatch. Hence they've resorted to these extremely childish tactics. Based on the timing of when this started, and when it has sporadically resumed, I can make some guesses about which individual/organisation, but those really are only guesses so I don't intend to say whom! Cheers, --[[User:Neoconned|Neoconned]] 11:03, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

Now, if I may wade in to this timely debate, I would like to point out that Neoconned is an individual that used to work for my firm but was fired after it was discovered that he had child pornography photos on his computer. I would like to point out that I tried hard to help him deal with his problem and even offered to pay for his treatment but it was thrown back in my face. Instead, he decided to write incorrect and harmful comments about people I know and the company on SourceWatch. None of Neoconned’s pages are fair or balanced. He manipulates everything he writes about. He also has a very strong personal relationship with Bob Burton who has given him carte blanch to attack people on SourceWatch. Also all wiki users should bear in mind that SourceWatch has been very critical of wikipedia. That includes Neoconned. Neoconned is also the person that has been phoning up people and harassing them as stated on his SourceWatch home page. Although Neoconned, or ‘Neo’ as he used to like to be called hides behind his alias I will not publicly embarrass him as it is up to him to reveal his identity. However, I do think it is very pertinent that he should tell people who he is. Why does he keep hiding behind his names and why does he keep ignoring this question? Where is the transparency?

== Prejudice from Pat Stuart ==

I actually knew Dr. Alberto Rivera and interviewed him in 1982. He's on the level. The WikiP page on him is not neutral and obviously biased in favor of the pro-Catholic party line. If Pat Stuart is a fact checker and neutrality keeper he's a hypocrite. I resent my changes being tossed out because of a prejudiced Pat Stuart who claims to be a Christian, further compounding his hypocrisy. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:24.214.146.99|24.214.146.99]] ([[User talk:24.214.146.99|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/24.214.146.99|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
:As per this comment: ''these contradictions led to the world-wide Protestant Reformation that re-discovered the essence of the Christian early church is salvation through faith in a pardon by Jesus Christ---not by good behavior in any church.'' I, for one, am a Protestant, and an unusually dedicated one, so I believe every word of this. But it's clearly a pro-Protestant, anti-Catholic message, and it has no place in the encyclopedia. If you think the rest of the article is biased, I encourage you to work on that. -[[User:Patstuart|Patstuart]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Patstuart|(talk)]][[Special:contributions/Patstuart|(contribs)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:52, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

==Prof. Mohammad Mujeeb==
Hiii

Thanks for the comments about my contribution regarding Prof. Mohammad Mujeeb. I very well understood, before adding it, that it may not be and should not be acceptable. My idea was to start the thread, and to gather information. If you observe there is nothing much about him, in the article except his role at JMI. 

I hope to get more information about him.

Thanks once again.

== Larry Craig == 

No Pat, you removed sourced articles about Larry Craig. And nowhere else is it mentioned in the article. [[User:69.86.190.128|69.86.190.128]] 23:34, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

== Reason  ==

Patstuart,

Mahound term was used by one or two peoples so it doesnt mean that it is his name's variant. And it is already there in Non-Muslim veiw of Muhammad. So there is no point to keep this word in variant. People are villify by many people but that doesnt mean it is his name variant. Everyone know the defination of variant. And 2ndly some people add this just because they hate him and wikipedia policy is neutral. So i want to keep this article away from skepticism, So that both muslims and non muslims would not be offended. I hope you will understand


Thanks you

==Apology==
Dear Mr. &quot;Patstuart&quot;, I am terribly sorry for any problems Franklin (ScoobyDooGuy1991) caused you, I just received his letter and he told me what happened. He's my sister's nephew, and for some reason is a huge fan of mine. The reason he caused all these problems was that he thought you were saying he was a liar, and knowing everything he said was true, it just hurt his feelings a little. I had a talk with him, and this shouldn't happen again. I am a little bit curious though, why there isn't anything on here about my coins, or me. I'm on tv.com and imdb.com, but it doesn't matter, I don't mind, I'm not too big a star. Again, I'm really sorry for any trouble that was caused. -Bradford N. Smith, and I'm new at this thing, so hopefully what I typed will show up correctly. Also, I typed this same thing in under &quot;Bradford Smith Good Luck Tokens&quot;, but I'm not sure if you saw it, so I thought I'd type it in here.

:I'm sorry about the incident, if it caused some hurt feelings. As the page is deleted, I can only speak from my memory, and from the log on your nephew's page, as to what it was. If I remember, it was some type of coins or pogs that he created and he and his friends liked to play. I do not doubt for a second that it was true, but it fails Wikipedia's [[WP:NN|notability]] guildelines, specifically [[WP:NFT]]; as Jim Douglas pointed out on [[User_talk:ScoobyDooGuy1991|Scooby]]'s userpage, there was only one google hit, and that was on this encyclopedia. Please understand that there are rules to Wikipedia, and we cannot accept just anything. As to yourself, I would encourage you to try to create a page for your name, however, I'm not sure if even that would pass [[WP:BIO]] (you also might want to tread carefully on the [[WP:COI|Conflict of interest]] page, should you create it). However, if you think you can prove notability, I encourage you to add the page.
:Also, please understand that your nephew was not banned for creating the page; it was for the way he conducted himself afterwards by vandalizing the talk pages of the people who had been involved in removing the page (my conscience is ticking at me; do me a favor and ''please'' don't get mad at him if you didn't know about this before; I wouldn't have written it if I thought you might). The official reason was a bad user name, which only holds some water (I don't think he was trying to impersonate anyone), but I suspect it had more to do with the vandalism. If your nephew were to appeal the block, he may or may not win, so long as he showed remorse, and promised to act in good faith from here on.
:Finally, if you're still seeking answers, I encourage you to look at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Bradford+Smith+Good+Luck+Tokens log history] of the Bradley Smith Good Luck Tokens page, and you can contact the administrator who removed it, as he can look on the actual contents of the page.  He can also give a more official voice to Wikipedia than myself.  -[[User:Patstuart|Patstuart]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Patstuart|(talk)]][[Special:contributions/Patstuart|(contribs)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:17, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

Thank you for replying back. I'll send a letter back to Franklin to tell him what you've said. He hasn't been punished or anything, so don't feel bad about it. Be forewarned, I'm sure he will be back on as soon as he has heard from me, but hopefully he won't cause any more problems. Let me know if he does, though, because I will be coming onto this site every chance I get, to see what he's up to. -Bradford N. Smith

Also, in your reference to the coins, those aren't a game or anything, they are things I have made and distributed all over the US.

I made no personal insult - if you read the conversation in its entirety that would be clear. Without meaning to sound petty, this stemmed from HawkerTyphoon calling me an &quot;idiot&quot;.

:No problem. Upon doing a little research, I found that there's already an article called [[Numinous]], which is somewhat described in [[religious experience]]. I think that you might find some duplicate ideas, however I'm sure that several of your ideas could be incorporated into both articles. The two articles would best be [[Wikipedia:Merging_and_moving_pages|merged]] (see the end of the article in the link). As for style, it looks pretty good, with two exceptions: 1) It's standard to put the name of the article on the top, and put it in bold (e.g., &quot;A '''Numinosum''' is...&quot;), and 2) Spacing issues (there are two spaces in betwen sections). But the latter is pretty irrelevant.

Hi. I tagged  [[Phantom city studio‎]] as a copyvio and blanked it, and noticed you changed that to db-copyio. I guess I didn't entirely realize those were different things, and was curious why you changed it. Thanks! [[User:Natalie Erin|Natalie]] 18:29, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
:Db-copyvio is a new thing, and was, I suspect, originally meant to stem the amazing increase in coyrighted material. It used  to read &quot;and was created in the last 48 hours&quot;, until Jimbo Wales, the creator and owner of Wikipedia (who is understandably paranoid about copyrights), changed it. Now, I would almost say the copyvio is a legacy tag. I changed it back to yours, however, because I could not find the text on the URL you mentioned. If you could find the exact URL where these words are mentioned, I imagine the administrators would probably fiond that helpful. -[[User:Patstuart|Patstuart]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Patstuart|(talk)]][[Special:contributions/Patstuart|(contribs)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:33, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

Hello Paststuart. You left me a notice on my article about [[Michael J. Bassett]]. This estabilished, and well loved director is quite important and critically allaimed.

:The article appears to be doing alright right now. It was not speedy deleted. It looks like it's asserting enough importance as is. Anymore, it will probably not be speedy deleted, only given a ''proposed deletion'' (needs to stay for 5 days) or an ''afd'' tag, which means community members discuss (it's much like a vote, though). I would place information under the dicussion page, however, explaining how you think Mr. Bassett fits the [[WP:BIO]] profile. Good luck. By the way, I thoroughly enjoyed Ned Divine.

Ok, this is a rhetorical question. :-)  But why do so many vandals spout off about &quot;free speech!&quot;?  Have they ever actually read the Bill of Rights?  Wikipedia isn't a branch of the United States government; it doesn't have free speech.  I'm sometimes tempted to ask one of those people to point me to where in the Constitution or Bill of Rights it says they have the right to scrawl their personal opinions on private property, but I suspect it would be a waste of time. -- [[User:Jim Douglas|Jim Douglas]] [[User talk:Jim Douglas|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Jim Douglas|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;(contribs)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]] 23:10, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
:I don't know man, my heart was just bleeding for his violated rights. He should be able to say whatever he wants, whenver.

== Personal attack?? ==
I wasn't attacking him. his tone in discussion was becoming increasingly distasteful, which i felt needed to be brought to his attention. come to think of it, all my discussons with admin. have been a bit distasteful. you guys seem to have a knack for being condescending and underhandedly rude.

this of course excludes you, as i have not noticed any particularly rude behaviour from you personally, and for that i thank you. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ianlarson|Ianlarson]] ([[User talk:Ianlarson|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ianlarson|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:::: By the way, there may still be copyright issues with the article.  Remember that the plot itself is covered under the copyright.  An article which is exclusively (or even a majority) plot summary can be considered a violation of the fair-use exception.  A proper encyclopedia article about a book should primarily include things like analysis, literary influence and social impact.  The version you have probably won't be speedy-deleted but we still have to bring the article into balance in a reasonable period.  Happy editing.

==Fair use rationale for Image:Redemption.jpg==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:Redemption.jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Redemption.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;

'''''Ierax''''' ({{lang-el|ΒΠ}} {{lang|el|Ιέραξ|italic=yes}}, &quot;Hawk&quot;) was a {{sclass2-|Wild Beast|destroyer}} which served in the Hellenic Royal Navy from 1912–1946.

== Origin ==
The ship, along with her three [[sister ship]]s {{ship|Greek destroyer|Aetos||2}}, {{ship|Greek destroyer|Panthir||2}} and {{ship|Greek destroyer|Leon||2}}, was ordered from [[England]].  They were purchased in 1912, ready for delivery, each for the sum of £148,000 from the English shipyards [[Cammell Laird]] in [[Birkenhead]], when the [[Balkan Wars]] seemed likely. These ships had originally been ordered by Argentina; ''Ierax'' was originally named ''Santa Fé''.  ''Ierax'' was accepted by Captain Ath. Miaoulis, RHN in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]]. where she arrived manned by foreign crew.

==Service history==
During the Balkan Wars, the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunitions, 3,000 rounds of torpedoes. Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship, and for this reason these ships were initially named 'scouts' rather than 'destroyers'. On October 21, 1912, under the command of Commander A. Vratsanos, RHN, ''Ierax'' was part of the Greek flotilla that captured the island of [[Psara]] from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicnavy.gr/ierax12_46_en.asp HELLENIC NAVY - IERAX D-36 (1912-1946)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]] and, due to Greece's neutrality the four Beast Class ships were seized by the Allies in October, 1916, taken over by the French in November, and served in the [[French Navy]] from 1917-18. By 1918, they were back on escort duty under Greek colors, mainly in the [[Aegean Sea]].

''Ierax'' participated in the evacuation of Greeks from Russia during the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918, and saw action in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]] and the [[Aegean Sea]].

After the war, ''Ierax'' was refurbished from 1925–1927.  She also participated in the [[Second World War]], after surviving the German invasion of April, 1941, ''Ierax'' was based in [[Alexandria, Egypt]].  In April, 1944, a wave of mutiny swept through some of the Hellenic Royal Navy, with seamen agitating in favor of the pro-[[Communist]] guerillas, [[Ellinikos Laïkos Apeleftherotikos Stratos|ELAS]], who were fighting a campaign in Greece against the occupying [[Nazis]].  ''Ierax'' was one of the ships whose crew mutinied and the mutiny was put down in the early morning hours of April 22, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Vice Admiral G. Mezeviris, &quot;Four Decades in the Service of the Royal Hellenic Navy&quot;, Athens, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of World War II, ''Ierax'' was stricken (decommissioned) in 1946.

== Composition of the Czech Senate after the 2006 elections ==

I have updated the table of the Senate election results, as the ones given were still those of the 2004 elections. Now it has the results of the October 2006 elections.

However, the Wiki page &quot;Senate of the Czech Republic&quot; still needs to be updated. 

Also, the Wiki page &quot;Elections in the Czech Republic&quot; (I see now that I finished here), reproduces this table and did already have an update, be it with a slightly different wording, and with a different source link. It would be good if any change in one would automatically appear in the other too - if anyone knows how to do that?

[[User:No-itsme|No-itsme]] 19:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

OK, it turned out I initially made a big mistake. Spotting that this page still had the 2004 Senate composition, I had proceeded to update ''the template'' that was linked in on this page - the template for the 2004 elections, that is - instead of just replacing it with the &quot;Senate election, 2006&quot; template, which did in fact already turn out to exist (that was the one already featured on the Wiki page &quot;Elections in the Czech Republic&quot;). 

That's solved now: I reverted those changes to the 2004 template, and on this page replaced that template with the 2006 one. I also updated the 2006 template with data from the Czech Statistical Office; and I inserted that table on the Wiki page &quot;Senate of the Czech Republic&quot; as well. So all should be well now..

== Important notice ==

The [[Outline of the Czech Republic#Government and politics of the Czech Republic|government section of the &quot;Outline of the Czech Republic&quot;]] needs to be checked, corrected, and completed -- ''especially the subsections for the government branches''.

When the country outlines were created, temporary data (that matched most of the countries but not all) was used to speed up the process.  Those countries for which the temporary data does not match must be replaced with the correct information.

Please check that this country's outline is not in error.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact [[User talk:The Transhumanist|&lt;i&gt;The Transhumanist&lt;/i&gt;]] .

Thank you.

== Government description incomplete ==

came to the page to understand administrative divisions- since redirected from &quot;Czech government&quot; which is distinctly different from &quot;politics&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi! I hate to do this, but I put up [[Katisha]] for deletion, since it's probably easier to understand the plot if not just from her perspective, and, as she doesn't appear in any other operas, it's hard to see how it could be expanded further (also, it's a little bit too enthusiastic, perhaps: I agree she's a great character, but it's an odd tone for an encyclopeda). 

However, I don't mean to put you off: Could I invite you into [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Gilbert and Sullivan]]? [[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

===[[List of weapons and items from the Ratchet &amp; Clank series]]===
I've been mulling this over for a while, and there is really no reason for this article. The original point of it was to keep all the weapon discriptions off of the main page, but times have since changed, and any info about weapons can be confortably contained in a gameplay section without a need for extensive lists.

*'''Delete''' All of the weapon descriptions are basically a summary of what they do in game, making this a game guide, which is prohibited by [[WP:NOT]].  [[User:ColourBurst|ColourBurst]] 20:47, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Per nom, well stated.  [[User:Wickethewok|Wickethewok]] 21:13, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a '''list of [[Technopole|technology centers]]''' throughout the world.  Governmental planners and business networks like to use the name &quot;silicon&quot; or &quot;valley&quot; to describe their own areas as a result of the success of [[Silicon Valley]] in [[California]].  Nevertheless, there are a few qualitative differences between these places, and metrics may be applied to measure their dominance.

These metrics include:
* How much and to what extent public and/or private research and development funds are spent in the zones
* What percentage of local employment is technology related.
* If the zone is mainly government funded or is mainly corporate driven (or both)
* If mainly corporate, how much revenue and profit and which corporates have headquarters there.
* If mainly corporate, how much [[venture capital]] has been made available to companies in the zone.
* What supporting higher educational institutions are located in nearby.

== Globally Prominent clusters (with specific dominant markets listed) ==
&lt;!-- Note: this area should be a summary of major globally dominant in a particular field.  If there isnt a particular market to point out, it does not belong in this section, but the worldiwde list section below--&gt;
 
*[[Silicon Valley]] - originating in Stanford University (Palo Alto and Menlo Park), and spreading south towards [[San Jose, California]] and suburbs. San Francisco and nearby areas including Berkeley and Oakland are technically not part of Silicon Valley but have seen growth in industries such as [[web development]] (2013-2016) and [[venture capital]].  Silicon Valley has maintained dominance for decades in core industries such as microprocessor development as well as software and web development.  
*[[Silicon Wadi]] - is an area with a high concentration of [[high-tech]] industries&lt;ref name=&quot;Viva Tel Aviv&quot;/&gt; in the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|coastal plain]] in [[Israel]].

John Davies Gilbert and his son, [[Carew Davies Gilbert]] played a major role, as landowners, in the development of the town of [[Eastbourne]] and also developed [[Trelissick Garden]] in [[Feock, Cornwall]].

In 1834 he was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] as his father had been.&lt;ref name=rs&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=6&amp;dsqSearch=(Surname='Gilbert') Royal Society archives for John Davies Gilbert]&lt;/ref&gt; but does not seem to have published any scientific papers.

:Intentionally removed the link to the site - but left the rest of information in - for clear context of this message.

:I believe the spirit behind the guidelines for usage of External links has to be understood. Also, the exact expectations from the people at large, from any encyclopedia has to be understood. Here are some points to help people understand why external links of this nature are not appropriate.

: ( A ) Point 4 of ''Important points to remember'' from [[WP:EL]] states
::''In the &quot;External links&quot; section, try to avoid separate links to multiple pages in the same website; instead, try to find an appropriate linking page within the site.''
: As can be seen by additions you have made, this is clearly violated.

: ( B ) Point 9 of ''Links normally to be avoided'' from [[WP:EL]] states
::''Any search results pages, such as links to individual website searches, search engines, search aggregators, or RSS feeds.''
: As can be seen by additions you have made, each and every link is a &quot;Search Results&quot; page.

: ( C ) Point 10 of ''Links normally to be avoided'' from [[WP:EL]] states
::''Social networking sites (such as Myspace and Facebook), chat or discussion forums/groups (such as Yahoo! Groups), Twitter feeds, Usenet newsgroups or e-mail lists.''
: As can be seen, your website states clearly ''The Music Student Network''.

: ( D ) '''Advertising and conflicts of interest''' from [[WP:EL]] states
::''It is obvious that a link from Wikipedia to an external site may drive Web traffic to that site. But in line with Wikipedia policies, you should avoid linking to a site that you own, maintain, or represent—even if Wikipedia guidelines seem to imply that it may otherwise be linked.''
: As it is your website, there is direct conflict of interest.

: ( E ) Finally point number 1 of ''Links normally to be avoided'' from [[WP:EL]] states
::''Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a featured article.''

: Since there are 1000s (if not millions) of renditions of ragas and alapanas available on the web, NO SINGLE resource can claim to be UNIQUE to be included in a particular raga page. Here, it should be understood that ''unique resource'' means ''extra ordinary resource'' that is ''reliable'' and referenced by a 3rd party review/ article/ published paper, etc. This ''default expectation'' of ''encyclopedic content'' cannot be bypassed simply because it has not been mentioned in the ''[[WP:EL]]'' - it is implicit requirement that experts and 3rd parties feel that raagabox is THE standard for learning the raga - which clearly it is NOT. No one has certified this.

:Hope in light of this you will stop promoting your website in Wikipedia articles. Thank you. [[User:VasuVR|&lt;font color = &quot;#F60&quot;&gt;VasuVR&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:VasuVR|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]], [[Special:Contributions/VasuVR|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;]]) 07:52, 17 December 2013 (UTC)

== disambiguation ==

'Atana' has meanings outside India so should be a disambiguation. For example, it is a variant spelling of Greek goddess [[Athena]], that if I recall, is the variant used in Sparta.--[[User:Dchmelik|dchmelik]] ([[User_talk:Dchmelik|t]]|[[Special:Contributions/Dchmelik|c]]) 04:33, 2 July 2014 (UTC)

Now the disambiguation page lists major meanings in four other languages... really should be a disambiguation.--[[User:Dchmelik|dchmelik]] ([[User_talk:Dchmelik|t]]|[[Special:Contributions/Dchmelik|c]]) 04:52, 21 February 2017 (UTC)

[[:Atana]] → {{no redirect|Atana (raga)}} – ‘Atana’ is in four or more languages with different meanings, probably all equally important. What an average Western scholar would know it as (so maybe also historical English usage, at least for classics &amp; European language scholars) is an alternate spelling of Greek name/goddess [[Athena]] or a theorized ‘proto-Athena,’ used in some areas of ancient Greece, which I'd prefer over the raga and other usages if one language should have the main name, but the disambiguation page should become the main article. [[User:Dchmelik|dchmelik]] ([[User_talk:Dchmelik|t]]|[[Special:Contributions/Dchmelik|c]]) 05:14, 21 February 2017 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' given that this is often called [[Raga atana]], the proposal makes sense. But not totally convinced that there really are other subjects at the [[Atana (disambiguation)]] page which are likely search topics. [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 09:43, 21 February 2017 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' I'm a classicist but admittedly not an ancient religion specialist. I don't think I've ever encountered the spelling &quot;Atana&quot; for Athena in any English-language scholarship -- nothing that would make a user of the English Wikipedia want to search for &quot;Atana&quot; in the expectation of finding the goddess. Maybe you can cite a source or two to show that this confusion could arise? [[User talk:Andrew Dalby|Andrew Dalby]] 09:47, 21 February 2017 (UTC)
::Now cited on [[Atana (disambiguation)]] talk page. I wasn't sure myself, but maybe reread what I said or the first source (which the section is available free on Google Books.) An Athena site says they are the same but the scholarly source only &lt;i&gt;theorizes&lt;/i&gt; they are the same, apparently with no conclusion. So, apparently Atana can be considered a separate ancient goddess (or any truth they are the same was not known at the time of the scholar's book, 1999, but some new source in [[Athena]] article might say.) She's so ancient to be a bit obscure to readers of Greek religion/mythology, but this is very relevant--relevant enough I'd say (that people reading about religion/mythology this far back would expect to see her mentioned first.)--[[User:Dchmelik|dchmelik]] ([[User_talk:Dchmelik|t]]|[[Special:Contributions/Dchmelik|c]]) 10:18, 21 February 2017 (UTC)
:::Thanks for replying. I'm not strongly for or against the move you propose but, looking further, I don't think claiming &quot;Atana&quot; as an alternative spelling for &quot;Athena&quot; supplies a valid reason. The relevant link had been deleted by someone from the disambiguation page, by the time I looked at it, and the reason given was that the spelling can't be found at [[Athena]]. Well, the reason for ''that'' is that there is one Linear B tablet which is cited at [[Athena]] correctly with hyphens as &quot;A-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja&quot;. That's all. It quite likely is a reference to an early form of the goddess Athena, but it doesn't mean the supposed goddess's name was ever &quot;Atana&quot;. A Linear B form ''A-ta-na'' could just as well stand for ''Athana'' or various other possible combinations. If anyone is really likely to try the Linear B spelling in a Wikipedia query (I doubt it, I admit), then we'd want a cross-reference from [[A-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja]] to [[Athena]]. That would take Athena out of this discussion. [[User talk:Andrew Dalby|Andrew Dalby]] 13:23, 21 February 2017 (UTC)
::::Well, it's back now, because there's more to that section (besides you can just omit the dashes from the words for the letters.) It also mentions ‘At(h)ana,’ in which this means the ‘h’ is optional. So, ‘Atana’ definitely is a variant, even if it wasn't sure it's a variant of Athena or just a group of similar goddesses, or a coincidence (if I recall, the scholarly (e)book I read, that also uses the spelling ‘Atana,’ said it's not clear it's Athens or a place with similar name.)--[[User:Dchmelik|dchmelik]] ([[User_talk:Dchmelik|t]]|[[Special:Contributions/Dchmelik|c]]) 13:31, 21 February 2017 (UTC)
:::::It's busy, isn't it? I've made a suggested change and a comment over at the disambig page. I'll leave it at that: best of luck to all. [[User talk:Andrew Dalby|Andrew Dalby]] 13:38, 21 February 2017 (UTC)
*'''Comment''', references don't ever belong on disambiguation pages. An existing English Wikipedia article linked to on the disambiguation page must support the claimed usage. Disambiguation pages are not an index of anything and everything that might have been mentioned somewhere. Also, this usage seems rather obscure. I think a stronger case is needed to displace the raga form. [[User:Bkonrad|older]] ≠ [[User talk:Bkonrad|wiser]] 12:55, 21 February 2017 (UTC)
*'''Comment''', classics is my field, so naturally I'm sympathetic to the idea of placing Athena on par with a form of musical composition.  But this strikes me as quite obscure, and not even clearly established.  A single inscription in Linear B that ''might'' be a reference to Athena, ''possibly'' a corresponding inscription in Linear A (which on the whole has yet to be deciphered), no references anywhere else in the whole body of works and inscriptions from classical antiquity.  And even if &quot;Atana&quot; is a reference to Athena, there's a credible argument to interpret it &quot;Athana&quot;.  It just doesn't seem important enough to displace an article about something that ''is'' spelled &quot;atana&quot;.  If it shared a name with a regular variant or an epithet of Athena, I could see doing this, but rare spellings in obscure tablets (and I mean that in the politest possible way; however fascinating they may be, there's no evidence that they directly influenced any surviving works of art or literature) just don't strike me as justification for this move.  [[User:P Aculeius|P Aculeius]] ([[User talk:P Aculeius|talk]]) 14:56, 21 February 2017 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' No other articles titled 'Atana'. [[User:Pppery|&lt;span style=&quot;position:relative;top:10px&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span style=&quot;position:relative;bottom:5px&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Pppery|e&lt;big style=&quot;position:relative;top:10px&quot;&gt;r&lt;/big&gt;y]] 15:05, 21 February 2017 (UTC)
* '''Comment''' I'm disinclined to this proposal. I doubt the average person looking for the article on the Greek goddess will look for &quot;Atana&quot; or &quot;Atena&quot; over the proper spelling &quot;Athena&quot;. And if a confusion can be shown to exist, put a head note on this article pointing to Athena. FWIW, it's more likely that someone would confuse a small town on the Pontic coast of Turkey once called &quot;Athina&quot; &amp; currently called [[Pazar, Rize|Pazar]] with the goddess; it's a part of the world with a few other oddly-named places, such as [[Of, Turkey|Of]]. -- [[User:Llywrch|llywrch]] ([[User talk:Llywrch|talk]]) 18:17, 21 February 2017 (UTC)

| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Wikipedia is a free-content encyclopedia [[m:List of Wikipedias|written in 250 languages]] by thousands of users like you and me from all walks of life. As a member of the [[WP:Wc|Welcoming Committee]], I would like to say thanks for being a part of this project.

Here are some links to help you, the new user, on your Wikipedia journey:

*[[Wikipedia:Introduction|Introduction]]
*[[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]]
*[[Help:Editing|Editing a page]]
*[[Wikipedia:Bootcamp|Bootcamp]]
*[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]
*[[Wikipedia:Five pillars|Five pillars]]

Whether you're new to the project or have helped us for a while, remember to use [[Help:Edit summary|edit summaries]] when you're done with a page. Summaries are important because, with those, other editors will understand what you have done with the content. '''REMEMBER''': think twice before clicking &quot;'''Save page'''&quot; below the editing box, since whatever you write in the summary box will permamently go in the [[Help:Page history|history of any page]]. (Spellchecking is important; you cannot change the summary data after you have finished editing.)

Remember, also, to sign your name with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) or by pressing this button ([[Image:Button sig2.png|Signature button]]) above the box, whenever leaving comments on [[Wikipedia:Talk page|talk pages]].

If you want to know how you're doing on Wikipedia, feel free to check out [[Special:Contributions/Erikun|your list of contributions]].

If you don't know how to do something, type &lt;nowiki&gt;{{helpme}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on your talk page, and [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]] will come to solve your problems.

After you've stayed here for a while, you might want to take an [[Wikipedia:Editor review|editor review]], or, even better, take a chance at [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship|adminship]].

Wherever the journey takes you, I wish you the best of luck and respect on Wikipedia. If you have any questions about my expertise or this site, you can [[Special:Emailuser/Slgrandson|e-mail me]] or [[User talk:Slgrandson|talk to me]], and I will see about the situation as best as possible.

In the meantime, happy editing!

== This article is... ==

...a disaster. The title is one thing, the infobox title says another, and the image (apart from having, from what I can tell of Tamil Nadu, only two words) is unsourced. Add the image to the title issues and we have a big annoyance. If nothing else, can someone post the exact name of the article, as transliterated (and as translated, if possible) from Tamil to English? It would be a start... &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: nowrap;&quot;&gt;[[User:Voyagerfan5761|Tuvok]][&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Voyagerfan5761|T]][[Special:Emailuser/Voyagerfan5761|@]][[User talk:Voyagerfan5761|lk]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Wikipedia:Editor review/Voyagerfan5761|Improve me]]&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 20:45, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

==Sources==
This article lacks sources, and is plainly not true. My edit calling for sources was reverted with an automated revert tool. That is not acceptable, hence I re-reverted. [[User:Arnoutf|Arnoutf]] 17:24, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
*If you don't agree with the article, tag it as being unsourced. Otherwise this is just another part of your edit war. --[[User:evrik|evrik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:evrik|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:33, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
: Sorry did so now. By the way the offical pass shows a pilgrims staff [http://www.caminosantiago.org/cpperegrino/consejos/credencial.asp] that does not look in any way as the description here. Very good sourcs are needed.  [[User:Arnoutf|Arnoutf]] 17:41, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
*Check out this [http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;q=Pilgrim's%20staff&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi collection of images]. There are many versions of the staff, but they all have thre cross piece. --[[User:evrik|evrik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:evrik|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:46, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
: No they all have some kind of hook (e.g. [http://www.latransfiguracion.com/tusok.JPG]) none of them have a cross that resembles the cross of St James. And more, these are not sources but [[WP:OR]] at best. [[User:Arnoutf|Arnoutf]] 17:48, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
*They don't all have the hook [http://int.kateigaho.com/spr05/forests-kumano.html][http://www.geocities.jp/jinseizen/jizo.htm], though the hook is a type of pilgrim's staff. This website shows both together [http://www.heraldsnet.org/saitou/parker/Jpglossp.htm]  [http://www.heraldsnet.org/saitou/parker/images/m460b.gif] --[[User:evrik|evrik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:evrik|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
: The current line is ''The walking stick has a cross piece on it so it resembles the Cross of St James''. However as you seem to agree that not even all sticks have a cross, this line has to be rewritten to ''The walking stick sometimes has a cross piece on it so it resembles the Cross of St James''; however even this claim cannot be made, as from the pictures we only know it sometimes has a cross, but not why. So an additional source is needed to make the claim that the actual reason for the cross is the resemblence and not some other reason. [[User:Arnoutf|Arnoutf]] 18:26, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
*I changed that as well. However, I left the fact tag on there. I'm running out of time today and will have to get back to this later. --[[User:evrik|evrik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:evrik|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 18:33, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
::Please provide the source soon, otherwise I will delete the line, which is the only line linking it to the cross, so I will also remove the cross; if you do not provide the reference. [[User:Arnoutf|Arnoutf]] 22:06, 7 April 2007 (UTC)
*I had forgotten. --[[User:evrik|evrik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:evrik|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 21:26, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
:: The second source is convincing about the heraldic stuff, but it only mention that the T-shape (or cross) is added to distinguish from pastoral staff, not that this was modelled on StJames cross. [[User:Arnoutf|Arnoutf]] 06:48, 10 April 2007 (UTC)
*If you look at the picture you'll see they look the same. --[[User:evrik|evrik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:evrik|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 19:42, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
: * You mean [http://www.heraldsnet.org/saitou/parker/images/m460b.gif]. That is actually just a pointed walking stick with a cross. It does not specifically resemble Cross St James over any other cross. Furthermore, the cross maybe there for a practical reason (e.g. to strap a watercarrier on) and need not be a religious symbol. Interpretation of an image like you do is original research, which is not allowed on wiki. Hence you still need a written source for this statement. [[User:Arnoutf|Arnoutf]] 20:06, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
*Oh pulleze, original research - that's a laugh. There is a clear relationship between St James and the pilgrim's staff. Unfortunately, I'm having difficulty finding the source that spoke of the St James Cross - Pilgrim's staff relationship. It is clear though if you look at the referenced image that there is a fitched end and the flory on the top. I'll keep looking next week. --[[User:evrik|evrik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:evrik|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 20:28, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
:: Sorry but laughing about someone exposing the weakness of your sources is plainly sad. With the same argument I could put a line in the article that the pilgrims staff is modelled after a combination of the Cross of Jesus where the head and point represent the spikes used to nail Christ to the cross. The image shows it all, clearly . No St James involved whatso-ever. Even so, you provide a single image with the tapered head and no source that this is standard; nowadays many pilgrims use telescopic alumnium poles because that refers to the sailing gear used to ship StJames from Palestine to Spain after his beheading..... These are just as foolish arguments as the one you are providing. 
:: As soon as you find an acceptable source you can put the image of StJames cross back up, untill then I take it off. [[User:Arnoutf|Arnoutf]] 20:59, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
*I just reverted your edit. This whole thing started because you wanted your image used - and violated [[WP:Point]] in the way you escaletd the discussion. You didn't even know that similar images already existed. Would you like to take this to mediation? --[[User:evrik|evrik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:evrik|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 21:47, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
:: That is your opinion; that someone disagrees with your idea of StJames cross is not making an edit to prove a point per se, I am just trying to improve wiki by critically reviewing every use of the so-called [[:Image:Stjamescross.png]]. If improving Wiki is against [[WP:Point]], then I am guilty as charged; if it is not, it seems you are to blame for [[WP:ABF]], [[WP:NPOV]] and indeed [[WP:Point]]. Note that you immediately starting accusing me of all kinds of WP policy violations, and with that you started with violating the [[WP:POLICIES|key policies]]. So please take it to mediation as you seem not to listen to either arguments or wiki policies.
:: With regard to your revert. The edit summary and your comment above just don't do. No consensus is needed to remove [[WP:REF|unreferenced]] or [[WP:OR|original research]] edits; otherwise anyone could put up any wild claim (e.g. Blue=Red) and then by arguing in favour of this prevent consensus from arising, thus keeping this claim up forever. I asked for a source a week ago, and it has not been provided (the given source is not relevant for the point under debate) hence I now removed the statement. I remain waiting for a relevant source before I will allow it back in [[User:Arnoutf|Arnoutf]] 17:16, 14 April 2007 (UTC)
*You'll allow it? When did you become owner of this article? You were seriously hurt that I didn't think that [[:Image:StJamesCross.gif]] wasn't a good image. You then started attacking everywhere where [[:Image:Stjamescross.png]] was placed. You then went and created [[:Image:StJames Cross.png]]. Let's see you've been edit warring, working against consensus and even after articles were sourced you were violating [[WP:Dick]]. This is a waste of time ... when i find the source i'll just add it back in ...  &quot;''so it resembles the [[Cross of St James]].''&quot;--[[User:evrik|evrik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:evrik|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 00:20, 16 April 2007 (UTC)
: Note that you were the first starting to throw around all kinds of accusations; wihout even trying to aks me why I removed all four installments of your cross. 
: By the way, thanks for taking the anon's user reinsertion out. The text that is up now is well sourced and believable. I never doubted that there was an association between StJames and the pilgrims staff. I am only not convinced that there is a causal relation between the staff in its sometimes form as a cross, and the actual (heraldic) cross of StJames. [[User:Arnoutf|Arnoutf]] 07:20, 16 April 2007 (UTC)
:: PS As I have been accused of [[WP:Dick|being a dick]] I decided to read the article. Well perhaps, my bold change of the crosses where needed was indeed a bit blunt. Perhaps I should have discussed first. An interesting other line I picked up in that same essay was (I quote) ''Telling someone &quot;Don't be a dick&quot; is something of a dick-move in itself''; interpret as you like.

'''Dental caries''', also known as '''tooth decay''', is uncommon among companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AVDS Cavities information page&amp;nbsp;— Dog Tooth Health&amp;nbsp;— Cat Tooth Health|url=http://www.avds-online.org/info/cavities.html|publisher=American Veterinary Dental Society|accessdate=10 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013002204/http://www.avds-online.org/info/cavities.html|archivedate=13 October 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus sanguis]]'' cause dental caries by metabolising sugars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dental Caries|url=http://en.wikivet.net/Dental_Caries|work=WikiVet|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''feline cavities'' is commonly used to refer to [[feline odontoclastic resorptive lesion]]s, however, sacchrolytic acid-producing [[bacteria]] (the same responsible for [[Dental plaque]]) are not involved in this condition.

== In dogs ==
Although rarely seen in cats, the incidence of caries in dogs has been estimated at approximately 5%.&lt;ref&gt;Hale FA. &quot;Dental caries in the dog.&quot; ''J Vet Dent.'' 1998 Jun;15(2):79-83. {{PMID|10597155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs are less likely than humans to have tooth decay due to the very high [[pH]] of dog saliva, which prevents an acidic environment from forming and the subsequent demineralization of enamel which would occur.&lt;ref&gt;Chris C. Pinney, The Illustrated Veterinary Guide for Dogs, Cats, Birds, and Exotic Pets (Blue Ridge Summit, PA: TAB Books, 1992), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event that tooth decay does occur (usually from trauma), dogs can receive dental fillings just as humans do.

== POV ==

The article claims to be about a song from ''[[Bride and Prejudice]]''. However the term &quot;Balle Balle&quot; has more to it than being just lyrics of a song. The term is quite popular in Punjabi and that aspect is not seen in the article. §§[[User:Animeshkulkarni|AnimeshKulkarni]] ([[User talk:Animeshkulkarni|talk]])  11:32, 20 July 2012 (UTC)</text>

== Sherry in U3 ==

Not sure about the computer version, but didn't you get the compass hearts from a character named Sherry in the NES version of U3?  Or is the chart referring to Sherry the Mouse?  [[User:Y0u|Y0u]] | [[User talk:Y0u|Y0ur talk page]] 20:03, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

== This list can't hold all the characters ==

The [[The Companions of the Avatar]] has a lot of characters which would not fit on the article here, therefore it perfectly reasonable to put them elsewhere.  Otherwise many notable characters would be lost.  Also, the ones who get mentioned here already, don't have nearly enough information about them, as they do over there.  Individual articles for all the companions were deleted/merged into the companions article.  Wikipedia isn't running out of space people.  No reason to destroy valid information, just to make it all fit here, and then to erase some notable characters from the list. [[User:Dream Focus | '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 20:03, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

== Merge discussion ==
; Merge discussion merge [[Lord British]], [[Avatar (Ultima)]] and [[The Companions of the Avatar]] into List of Ultima characters? 

The merge discussion should be here, not at [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Video_games#Lord_British]]. [[User:Dream Focus | '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 01:21, 20 August 2009 (UTC)

It has been suggested that [[Lord British]], [[Avatar (Ultima)]], and [[The Companions of the Avatar]] be merged into this article or section.  I say '''Keep''' for all three.
* '''Keep''' [[Avatar (Ultima)]] which just closed as Keep at AFD.
* '''Keep''' [[Lord British]] as a highly notable character, with plenty of mention in the real world press, as the game character and the persona of famed game designer [[Richard Garriott]].
* '''Keep''' [[The Companions of the Avatar]] as the information would make this article too long, so its valid to place it in a separate article.  Removing a large chunk of the content to merge it over, as someone has tried to do, and eliminating most of the companions to make it all fit, is ridiculous.  Just keep it over there. [[User:Dream Focus | '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 01:28, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
:First, as the closer stated, the result of the AfD has no effect on a merge discussion, so please do not use that as a reason to keep it. Now for a few quick questions: Do you even care about quality articles? Do you see any of these three becoming good or featured articles? If I just said &quot;Screw it, it's not worth it.&quot;, would you even touch these afterward? Really, I mean, you whine and moan about the evil deletionists destroying such important information, but do you honestly even care about anything more than the principal of these characters having articles? It is so annoying playing this whole game with people like you, who go on and on about how important this stuff is, and then when its all over, the articles just sit in the same poor state for years.

:How exactly is the section on Lord British any different from the article? The first paragraph deals with the creation, the second deals with the character's role in the series, and the third deals with the whole &quot;immortality claim.&quot; That is no different from the article, but it is nice and compact. Does it really make the character unimportant just because it has a few paragraphs and no title? In the time that you've wasted trying to protect it, you probably could have at least gotten one Ultima game article to GA status, but instead, all you have is a single page that does not assert any sort of real notability at all. [[User:TTN|TTN]] ([[User talk:TTN|talk]]) 02:16, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
::Quality level is not a valid reason to eliminate something.  You may see 99% of the articles on Wikipedia is unimportant, but they matter to someone.  I see nothing wrong with the articles, having found them interesting to read, and believe they meet all requirements to exists on Wikipedia.  The article sent to AFD closed as Keep, proving its notability.  Only the nominator thought it something that should be deleted. [[User:Dream Focus | '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 02:21, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
:::Reduced the whole Lord British to four paragraphs. In the process, no encyclopedic information was lost, and it could probably be shortened further. Stuff like &quot;how to kill British in this or that game&quot; violates [[WP:GAMEGUIDE]] and got chopped out. As for the rest, not much when you really work on the text is being said: the majority is just drawn out wording or unrelated details.--[[User:Kung Fu Man|Kung Fu Man]] ([[User talk:Kung Fu Man|talk]]) 02:54, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
:::The finished result could easily fit into the list as the four paragraphs now.--[[User:Kung Fu Man|Kung Fu Man]] ([[User talk:Kung Fu Man|talk]]) 02:58, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
::::In order to get your way, you went over and deleted more than half of that article, erasing not just the well covered assassination bit, but other valid content.  I undid your changes.  Please use the talk page there to discuss things before editing again. [[User:Dream Focus | '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 03:09, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
::::::There was not point in &quot;getting my way&quot;, I edited so that a) trivia was removed b) it was worded so as to not be as overly wordy and c) primed it for any real world information that can readily be added. So if you want to keep it, start adding reception and other real-world content.--[[User:Kung Fu Man|Kung Fu Man]] ([[User talk:Kung Fu Man|talk]]) 03:16, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' the AFD was !voted as keep, Dreamfocus, you can contact everyone in the AfD about this attempt to merge, as long as it is a neutral message, and you contact everyone. [[User:Ikip|Ikip]] ([[User talk:Ikip|talk]]) 03:23, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Well I made a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lord_British&amp;oldid=308998447 reasonable attempt] to give the article some much needed [[Exlax]] so notability can be proven. It's a shame because I think with some work it might be important enough for an article, but apparently Dream Focus wishes to assume bad faith, [[User:Dream Focus|conspiracy theories]] (yes I said it, deal with it) and [[WP:OWN|onwership]]. Bleh.--[[User:Kung Fu Man|Kung Fu Man]] ([[User talk:Kung Fu Man|talk]]) 03:34, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
*:You don't want notability proven, since as soon as you were done, you went over to the merge discussion and said you had hacked it down enough to be easily merged.  It isn't a conspiracy theory, to notice what is obvious before you.

Yes, there was only one &quot;Delete&quot;, but I believe that was the result of the comment about GDFL's impact on merged content. That's why there was a chunk of &quot;Redirect&quot; and &quot;Merge&quot;'s. However, many of the &quot;Keep&quot;'s did not cite any policy or guideline. Most simply stated that the character ''deserves'' its own article based on ''common sense'' that the character appeared a lot, which is not how Wikipedia is structured. When asked to provide sources, very few were supplied despite the assertion that many exist. If those in favor of Avatar remaining its own article, then I suggest the quickest way to end this is to provide said sources to satisfy [[WP:V]] and [[WP:RS]]. Because in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avatar_%28Ultima%29&amp;oldid=308982994 article's current state], I have to agree the article is not up to standards and a merge would strengthen this list.

The list itself can be expanded upon and possibly reach FL status with some work, so including these within the list to strengthen it makes perfect sense.

:Dream- I am considering the notability of the article. Given the sources and content presented, I have to say it is not notable enough. You can always change my mind by presenting me with more sources though. Also, I can't help but feel we have different definitions of &quot;notability&quot;. Yes the Avatar is an important and well-known character. But per [[Wikipedia:Notability]], &quot;''a notability determination does not necessarily depend on things like fame, importance, or the popularity of a topic''&quot;. &quot;''If a topic has received &lt;u&gt;significant coverage&lt;/u&gt; in &lt;u&gt;reliable sources&lt;/u&gt; that are &lt;u&gt;independent of the subject&lt;/u&gt;, it is &lt;u&gt;presumed&lt;/u&gt; to satisfy the inclusion criteria for a stand-alone article.''&quot; The article in its current state does not meet that criteria.
:So again, the quickest way to settle this is to present the sources you and others have said existed. The fact this is the ''fifth'' time I've asked you to do this is very disconcerting.

=== Arbitrary section break ===

Dream, while I know you are doing what you can to improve the articles for the readers, you have to keep Wikipedia's intended audience in mind. Encyclopedic video games are not written for gamers and as such Ultima articles are not written for Ultima enthusiasts. Our articles here on Wikipedia are written for general readers that may or may not know anything about the subject and its related topic. So while you may consider the fact that the Avatar rarely speaks, the general reader may not. As such, we have to tailor the content to provide proper weight to facts, and real-world perspectives are always favored over fictional ones.

Combining them will make the topic greater by eliminating excess detail that does not further the general reader's understanding of the topic. See [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts]] and [[List of characters in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow]] for examples. Each major character previously had their own article, but they provided nothing of real-world importance to a general reader. A few, however, kept their own article space because they were cleaned up, like [[Soma Cruz]].

Regardless, the sources are rather minimal, they look like just passing mentions, and I don't believe that equates to &quot;significant coverage&quot;. I'm sorry, but other than [[WP:IAR]] and [[WP:UCS]], which is really just a detailed extension of the former, no other policy or guideline has been presented that supports [[Avatar (Ultima)]] remaining a stand alone article. 

Bridies- If this discussion will only result in an edit war that better the two sides, I also believe a request for comment would help. ([[User:Guyinblack25|Guyinblack25]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Guyinblack25|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:59, 21 August 2009 (UTC))
:Wikipedia's intended audience?  Where is that listed at.  Wiki means casual, doesn't it?  And these character articles have been around for years, then suddenly a small number of people decided to change the notability guidelines, without a general vote or most being aware of it, and then got together in various wikiprojects, to find every single character page there was, and eliminate them.  Even [[Princess Zelda]] has her page challenged.  And I don't need any policy other than the one I have cited, no one caring about your suggested guidelines.  No one can take them seriously anyway, since there was no general vote, they just the opinion of a small number of people who camp out there and argue nonstop to get their way.  Most people have stated it should be kept, it just a small number of you determined to eliminate.  Accept the will of the people, consensus clearly established, and stop trying to wikilawyer.  Some people have no interest in history, science, sex, cartoons, comics, video games, or many other categories of articles on the wikipedia, and they simply ignore them.  If you don't like it, you won't be searching for it, and thus won't notice it exists at all.  If thousands of people read it each year, and enjoy it, then leave it be.  What you consider excess detail, we consider interesting and relevant facts.  If there is anything you don't think belongs there, discuss it on the relevant talk page, and form a consensus.

Both sides claiming consensus in above merge discussion; additional opinions sought. [[User:Bridies|bridies]] ([[User talk:Bridies|talk]]) 16:29, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

After some consideration, my stance is that of '''merge'''. The &quot;List&quot; article is plot information and should be subsumed into the plot summaries of the specific game articles. As I mentioned above, the short references on the Lord British article do not warrant the large section on killing the character, but perhaps a sentence or two in [[:Ultima (series)]]. This is not a case where I choose to &quot;ignore all rules&quot;, I believe using the style guide, notability guidelines and verifiability policy will make for a better encyclopedia.

DreamFocus, okay, woah, whats all this abount me refusing concencus and performing a merge? Let me clarify a bit further, just looking at the Lord British article for now. There seems to be two main objections to the merge: a) it would make the target article too long, b) British is a notable character. My counter argument is that a) If the article was written to standards of Verification policy, I think it would be much shorter, and b) With the sources presented, the subject does not pass the GNG as written. In order to demonstrate this point, I offered to edit the target article (adding my imagined succinct version), to show what this might look like and get another opinion of the other &quot;keep&quot; users above. It can be reverted if no-one likes it. I am ''not'' talking about doing a redirect and copy-paste. If you still feel that my proposal is still uncivil, then I'm sorry, I'll go away any not voice my opinion any further. I'll be honest here. To me, coming into the discussion at the point I did, this looks like one person shouting &quot;NO CONCENSUS&quot; at anyone who comes along and gives an opposing view. [[User:Marasmusine|Marasmusine]] ([[User talk:Marasmusine|talk]]) 09:30, 23 August 2009 (UTC)
:I was talking about Guyinblack25.  See his recent post above you.  He is determined to do it against consensus.  He previously posted ''Look, it's quite clear you don't agree with us and have no plans to (if I misinterpret that, I apologize). So I hate to play this card, but we'd be well within Wikipedia's rules to merge the Avatar article's content to this list and change it to a redirect.'' There is no consensus to merge. Consensus is the opinion of everyone, not just everyone certain people agree with.  The others have already argued about that definition of consensus, trying to discredit those who believe the articles are fine. Anyway, if you think anything needs citations to prove it, then add a citation needed tag on it.  Everything is easily verified in it.  Just no sense doing that with every single sentence, unless someone honestly doubts any of the content.

::The problem isn't just references, it's the weight given to those references (&quot;Hey, I'm going to prop a whole character on the fact players kill him a lot!&quot;), the fact there is no reception or otherwise notability for the character itself (even characters popular based on sex appeal have something said about the character itself. What's said about Lord British or any of the others in that regard? Nothing), the huge use of peacock words, &quot;cruft&quot; and other content that could easily be cut out of the whole mess (oh and the fact if anyone dares try you run around reverting and screaming OH NO HE'S DELETING MOST OF THE ARTICLE, when if an editor can justify it it should be their perogative to do so to a clearly sub-par article so it agrees with ''all'' policies), and not to mention this whole event reeks of you feeling ownership of these items...

Dream- I'm sorry our interactions are becoming hostile, but I feel I must say that I don't appreciate your comment about me above. You are quoting me out of context in what appears to be an effort to portray my views as something it originally was not. Which as stated at [[Wikipedia:Civility#Engaging in incivility]], is an act of incivilty: &quot;''Quoting another editor out-of-context to give the impression that he or she holds views they do not hold, or to malign them&quot;''. Reading my full comment in the subsection above does not give the impression you stated. I'm sorry if you misinterpreted it, but I ask you to please [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]]. Such comments are not constructive to the discussion and circumvent the real issue. I have made my point several times over the course of this very lengthy discussion, and I'm sorry we couldn't come to an agreement. At this point, I see no reason for either of us to continue discussing. We should allow others to freely make their own points and wait for an arbitrator of some kind to close the discussion.

== An outside opinion ==

Rather than focusing on these secondary character articles, perhaps a better tactic is to improve the parent articles. Look at [[Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss]]. It's a featured article. Now look at [[Ultima Online]]. It's C-class according to [[WP:WikiProject Video games]] assessment, and I'd say that's a very generous rating. None of the other games are even close to achieving a good article ranking, and most only have one or two references. It's pretty tough to sell an argument for individual character articles when the articles on the games they appear in are in such terrible shape.

==Lord British==
Should there be seperate sections for Lord British (Richard Garriot) and his character Lord British in Ultima, who came Sosaria with the serpent pendant, walking through, the gate, etc. And anything else I'm not sure of. There is a section on him in the NES Ultima Exodus hintbook, saying before he was King of Britannia he did numerous good deeds, with Iolo, Dupre and Shamino, etc. [[User:The snare|The snare]] ([[User talk:The snare|talk]]) 06:32, 6 February 2012 (UTC)
:We had an article for [[Lord British]] but it was &quot;merged&quot; against consensus, by a small number of determined people who argued everyone else to death.

Little is known about the wandering philosopher known as Altheides of [[Cyprus]], and little of his work remains available to modern scholars. His parents were Greek merchants living on the island under the rule of [[Guy of Lusignan]]. He was born a year before Guy's death, in 1193. At some point in his late teens he left [[Cyprus]] as a seaman on a Moorish trading vessel.
==Altheides the philosopher==
{{unrefsect|date=July 2010}}
Altheides again turns up in historical records with the founding of his School of Philosophy in [[Jerusalem]] in 1226, under the rule of [[al-Kamil]], the nephew of [[Saladin]] and ruler of [[Jerusalem]]. His school was never particularly successful, and dispersed shortly after [[al-Kamil]]'s treaty of 1229 signing the city back over to the [[Crusaders]]. From this point very little is known. Scattered accounts and writings appear here and there in as varied locations as [[Spain]], [[Morocco]], [[Rome]], and [[Egypt]]. Altheides died near his childhood home on [[Cyprus]] in 1262.

==Works==
Altheides never wrote a serious philosophical work or treatise and is primarily known for his many wise sayings, primarily found in other works written in the early thirteenth century.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are running towards a precipice; we can but hope that when we reach the edge we shall be able to fly. [Of education and training, Jerusalem, 1227]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If anyone asks you if you can do something, have only two answers: 'yes' and 'not yet.' [Jerusalem, 1227]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A clever man is capable of solving puzzles, and a knowledgeable man knows many answers. But only a wise man knows which puzzles to solve and which questions to ask. [Of human perception of intelligence, Athens, 1236]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Life is full of boundaries; a life lived within them is a life not worth living at all. [Athens, unknown year]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] ==
Explain to me please how five books and ONE movie makes a franchise? While there have been other formats, but through the debates I've had here, most fans only know of the books, and now the movie, and only about the plays, radio and tv series through the secondary literature. Franchise also implies to me of a corporation using a single story/idea and making multiple shows/movies/etc out of that idea, when nearly every edition of H2G2 was done by one man. --[[User:JohnDBuell|JohnDBuell]] | [[User talk:JohnDBuell|Talk]] 02:58, 12 October 2005 (UTC)
:Ok, in the [[UK]], where H2G2 originated, they first had the radio plays. These are repeated every so often on [[BBC]] and the like, and are one of the most, if not the most, know version in the [[UK]]. The first books were based on the radio plays. Further books were then released. A short TV series was made, which also appears every so often on [[BBC]] and the like. More books (and a lot of merchandise) were released. Then the movie, and finally more radio plays based on the last of the books. Not to mention all the spin-off stuff. So if that is not definable as a franchise, nothing is. It's all in the article. And just because it was all done by one man (and it wasn't), doesn't mean it can't be a franchise. --[[User:JQF|JQF]] | [[User talk:JQF|Talk]] 03:30, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

Sorry, we can't use copyright images like [[:Image:GuanlongWucaii.jpg]]. [[User talk:Gdr|Gdr]] 15:50, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

:You need to demonstrate that it has a license that we can use. [[User talk:Gdr|Gdr]] 15:59, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

According to ''Nature'' [http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060206/full/060206-5.html], the picture is © Zhongda Zhang/IVPP (IVPP is the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in China). What evidence do you have that we have permission to use it? [[User talk:Gdr|Gdr]] 16:16, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

:As I said, how do you know? [[User talk:Gdr|Gdr]] 16:26, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

You know that CNN think it's OK to use it. But that doesn't mean that it's in the public domain. It's very likely that the press release is copyrighted and comes with conditions on use and distributions. These  conditions may allow CNN to use the image but not us. If you can point to the original press release (perhaps on the IVPP website?) we can see what it says.

You should read [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-January/001998.html this mail thread] and maybe contribute your expertise to [[Talk:News release]]. [[User talk:Gdr|Gdr]] 16:45, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

== River Tam ==

I tend to disagree with your change in River's occupation. First of all, she's a pilot for, what, five minutes of the movie? Compared to about 16 hours of being a fugitive with no on-board job. But maybe more importantly, it's a pretty big spoiler for those who haven't seen the movie. If a sequel comes out, it might make sense to change it, but for 99.9% of the series, Wash is the pilot.

I'm pointing out the fact that multiple people at GAF sign up for NPD's sales report (such as two users who go by the name crazy buttocks on a train and bunkum) - and IGN/GS don't. They don't get the sales information from the companies unless the companies make a press release, it is NPD's job, and it requires a great sum of money for a yearly subscription, and IGN/GS do not sign up for numbers, only getting the top 25 in $$$ and in units sold.

I was just wondering what it does? --[[User:DakAD|DakAD]] 15:52, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

:Thiat template &quot;clears&quot; both margins. It's used with pics and other templates to ensure that text is wraped to either create space or cram text where it shouldn't go. For example, I added it to PvP article because the character bit of Francis was crammed over to the side under the pic of him and Brent, creating a white space. By adding it, Francis' describtion not cevers the full page. 
:Oh, and for futer ref, if you type Template:[template name] into the search box, you can see the template's page, and their is usually some info their to explain it's functions. For this template you would go to [[Template:-]]. [[User:JQF|JQF]] 20:12, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

:::::I'm sure. People in the VIP section of the site have created stills of the video called &quot;The Ink To Game Process&quot;, in it Cyclops and Colossus are clearly seen being beaten by Dr. Doom, this is the only source we have as far as I'm aware of Colossus being in the game, yet he got NPC status on the table from it. There are shots where bodies are seen on the floor, the Hulk is the biggest of these, and therefore easily identifiable. Gambit is in the foreground, with cards lying near his hand, this is all we can really confirm from this clip. There are bodies in the distance that people have speculated may be Shadowcat and Emma Frost, there is a blur even further in the distance, which people are debating over: some believe it to be Beast, others believe it to merely be rubble.

== I may not want a Wii ==

I know your userpage states that you prefer the Nintendo Wii over other consoles.  I considering not to buy the Nintendo Wii because of a conflict involving ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''.  It is due to the character suggestion battle between [[Lip (Nintendo)|least favorite Nintendo character]] and [[Ayra|my favorite Nintendo character]].  Unfortunately, the odds are in favor of the former.  According to my userpage, I prefer the PS3 over other consoles, and I loathe the Wii.

== [[Ad Astra (convention)|Ad Astra]] is not a TV show! ==

I'm very, very curious as to why you thought back in January that Toronto's [[Ad Astra (convention)|Ad Astra]] convention should be &quot;within the scope of [[WP:CANTV|WikiProject Canadian TV shows]]&quot; as it's not really related to television (it's more of a sci-fi/fantasy [[Literature|lit]] convention). I'm unilaterally removing the project block template from the article's talk page, since it is quite apparent that the article is not within the aforementioned scope. --[[User:Coldacid|coldacid]] 19:22, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

:It comes from [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Canadian TV shows#Anime conventions|a discussion]] that any conventions that are held with in Canada that focuses on or significantly includes television would be included within the scope of [[WP:CANTV|WikiProject Canadian TV shows]]. That said, I went through all of the [[:Category:Science fiction conventions in Canada]] articles, which included [[Ad Astra (convention)|Ad Astra]]. I probably didn't read the article to double check that it didn't include television, assuming that it did, and added the cat. I'm sorry for the mis-labeling, and thank you for bringing it to my attention. [[User:JQF|JQF]] • [[User talk:JQF|Talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JQF|Contribs]] 19:32, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

::Makes sense. Yeah, there isn't much relating to anything shown on TV. Even the token anime room at the convention had perhaps 5 to 10 people at any given time (or at least during the time that I was supervising it this year) -- mostly, it's panels and other discussions on matters literary and I wouldn't have it any other way (although gaming could be better, but that's up to me to deal with anyway). Don't worry too much about the mislabelling, the chances are that I'd probably do the same to any convention I that wasn't too knowledgable about. --[[User:206.186.79.91|206.186.79.91]] 20:34, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for uploading or contributing to '''[[:Image:Darwin_XMDG.JPG]]'''. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  [[WP:FURG|here]].

Please go to [[:Image:Darwin_XMDG.JPG|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:GuanlongWucaii.jpg]]'''. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]], but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our [[Wikipedia:Fair use criteria|first fair use criterion]] in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information.

# Go to [[:Image:GuanlongWucaii.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to add {{tlx|di-replaceable fair use disputed}}, '''without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template'''.
# On [[Image talk:GuanlongWucaii.jpg|the image discussion page]], write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission|requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license]], or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria.

With the [[Calgary municipal election, 2007|municipal election]] coming up, I figured it would be good to have another local meet of Wikipedia contributors in Calgary.

== Broken {{N}} template and non-[[WP:MINOR]] edit ==

Hello. Please avoid making [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:N&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=137650300 rather careless edits such as this one] without first checking the documentation, fully testing in a sandbox, or asking on the talk page or the Help Desk.

I know you meant well, you wanted a column of {{tl|Y}}'s and {{tl|N}}'s to be sortable, but adding text like this was poised to mess the template and the pages using it, since (1) the white &quot;N&quot; will be visible on pages that do not use a white background or for editors who changed the default skin, (2) the &quot;N&quot; still creates extra whitespace that destroys indentations or line-ups:

* {{Y}} This was in line
* {{N}}&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;N&lt;/font&gt; This was not in line because of the white &quot;N&quot;
* {{Y}} This was in line

This is all explained at [[Help:Sorting]] (a subpage linked from [[Help:Table]]) along with the solution. Anyway, I have now fixed the {{Tl|N}} with a proper &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;&lt;NOWIKI&gt;&lt;SPAN STYLE=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;N&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/NOWIKI&gt;&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and BTW updated all check/cross templates so that they are now sortable too.

Also, your edits were concealed as minor but are definitely not [[WP:MINOR]] edits. The Minor flag is only for the most minuscule edits (such as adding a missing period at the end of a sentence or removing an extraneous ]] on a link), anything else that some other editors may want to be aware of, even changing a single word, is defined as non-minor by policy.

Please take this in consideration for your next edits, thanks. &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Komusou|Komusou]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Komusou|''talk'']]&lt;/sup&gt; @ 00:29, 20 September 2007 (UTC)

:Sorry about that. As it says on my page, I tend to [[WP:BOLD|be bold]] in my edits, but I'll try to be better about that in the future. Had I known about the span code option, I would have gone with that. 

:I was trying to make those columns sortable, as there are several tables that use multiple Y/N template columns, which can be difficult to process without sorting options.

:As for the Minor edits, I have &quot;Minor Edits&quot; to be on by default, and don't un-check it unless I make a large edit (ie a couple of sentences), thinking this the norm. I'll have to read over [[WP:MINOR]] so see how I should be doing things.

=== Request Information===
&lt;!-- Please leave your answers as concise as possible. --&gt;
: '''Request made by:''' [[User:Geoff B|Geoff B]] 20:04, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

; ''Where is the issue taking place?''
: ... [[Slither (film)]] and [[Talk:Slither (film)]]

; ''Who's involved?''
: ... [[Tromaintern]] and [[66.159.192.213]], principally.  There have been other editors regurgitating the same debate earlier, and possibly some sockpuppetry.

; ''What's going on?''
: ... Revert war between someone who does like the film and someone who doesn't.  

; ''What would you like to change about that?
: ... I'd like it to stop so we have a stable article we can work on.

; ''Would you prefer we work discreetly? If so, how can we reach you?''
: ...  No, be as open as you like.  The conflict itself is not exactly subtle.  Feel free to leave a message on my Talk page or email me.

=== Mediator response ===
&lt;!-- MEDIATORS: Change the status at the top of the page to &quot;open&quot; when you take it so our bot can put it in the proper section.--&gt;
I will be mediating. If you have proof of sockpuppetry, and the users, file a [[WP:RFCU]] request. G[[User:Geo.plrd/Esperanza|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;]]o. 19:11, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
:I'm afraid there has been rather a lot of deletion going on on the Talk page (which seems to have abated, thankfully) so the only thing left is an allegation of sockpuppetry.  [[User:Geoff B|Geoff B]] 19:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
:Do you believe a user is a sockpuppet and if so do you have the proof for a Checkuser proceeding? G[[User:Geo.plrd/Esperanza|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;]]o. 00:45, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

:Presently, it's between [[Tromaintern]] and [[66.159.192.213]].  The article has passed through several spates of activity where two editors cannot seem to come to an agreement, and revert back and forth.  This is merely the most recent.  I believe there was an earlier appeal for mediation (got nowhere), and someone from 3rd opinion turned up (calmed things down for a short while but again, no agreement was reached).

==Return of the Brothers of Destruction==
Anyone heard any rumors on the return of the [[Brothers of Destruction]] since The Undertaker and Kane are now on the same show. Maybe a &quot;resurrection&quot; of Paul Bearer as their manager.--[[User:Dontmesswithsess91|The Sess]] 22:53, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

==Change the Picture already==
The picture doesn't even show the front of his face and you can tell the picture has been zoomed in on because of its pixely appearence. Here's an idea lets put a picture up that shows his current persona and make sure it is actually perfessionally taken.--[[User:Dontmesswithsess91|The Sess]] 22:06, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

It's way better than the other one. The old one didn't show his face, it was from the side, and it wasn't even his gimmick. This new FREE USE picture actually shows his face and his gimmick. If people want to see another picture, just scroll down in the article. --[[User:Mikedk9109|&lt;font color=&quot;Black&quot;&gt;'''Mikedk9109'''&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mikedk9109|&lt;font color=&quot;Green&quot;&gt;sup&lt;/font&gt;]]) ([[Special:Contributions/Mikedk9109|&lt;font color=&quot;Green&quot;&gt;stalk me&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:34, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

Mike, I'm begging ya. I'm begging ya. really. guys, help me out here. Mike, don't shorten it. it looks bad

The article is too long and looks boring. It needs mixed up and is was way past the wikipedia article size limit before i trimmed and cleaned it up. This is an encyclopedia not a match-by-match news site. Just like there is no week-by-week, why should there be so many previous events that happened really close in time. They just arent needed for this article.

== Undertaker's height and weight ==
6'5? Are you smoking crack? Wow, ok ive seen this guy live ringside, and he is a lot bigger than 6'5.
He is more like 6'8. Hes like Kane, he wears padded heels in his boots. -Undertakerlives

6'10''? Whoever put that in was smoking crack. The guy's only like 6'5 1/2'' - wrestling stats are complete lies.

Undie is two inches shorter that Nash and Nash legit height is 6'9. I would guestimate Undie is 6'7. The WWE stats are rubbish tho, yes.([[User:Halbared|Halbared]] 13:36, 30 March 2006 (UTC))

Shouldn't some differentiation be made between the Undertaker's real height and weight and his billed height and weight? His billed WWE stats are 6ft 10 ins and 305 lbs (not 328, ignore WWE.com, they just haven't bothered to update his Superstar page! If you listen to the ring announcer when the Undertaker is making his way to the ring, he quite clearly says 305 lbs). However, in real life, he is in actual fact only 6ft 8 ins and 280 lbs. [[User:Luke Edhouse|Luke Edhouse]] 02:10, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

The weight sounds accurate, he is in the best shape he has been in for years. Where did you get the height from?([[User:Halbared|Halbared]] 20:12, 7 April 2006 (UTC))

Actually, he's legitimately 305 lbs, but his real height is 6'8&quot;. [[User:Trosk|Trosk]] 21:29, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

He isn't legitimately 305 lbs at all [[User:Trosk|Trosk]], it is a known fact that WWE exaggerate both the height and weight of their talent to make them appear bigger. Although the Undertaker is billed as being 6' 10&quot; and 305 lbs, Calaway is in fact only 6' 8&quot; and 280-285 lbs (it fluctuates slightly from time to time obviously, but he tends to remain in the 280-285 pound region these days). [[User:Luke Edhouse|Luke Edhouse]] 04:38, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

How would you know his real weight?  You work for him? [[User:Trosk|Trosk]] 15:05, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

::To [[User:Trosk|Trosk]]: No, I do not work for him, but &quot;Toxxic&quot;, a top wrestling magazine often features listings of wrestlers' real heights and weights as opposed to what the wrestling promotions bill them as. In WWE, for example, the general rule is that in certain cases, 2 inches are added on to a talent's height and 20-30 pounds is added on to a talent's weight to make them appear even larger than they already are. In the Undertaker's case, his WWE weight is 305 lbs, however, his real weight is in the region of 285 lbs (as reported in Toxxic). Also, although you'll come across a few discrepencies on the Internet, if you check out one of the top, most reliable unofficial Undertaker websites [http://www.phenomforever.com/info/factfile.php PhenomForever.com], it backs this up based on real wrestling data information sources as opposed to 'manufactured' ones I guess you could call them. 

Well to be acturate the undertaker is 6' 11 and a half and i know this because i have a picture take with him and i with a height chart behind us but he's out of his undertaker get up just dressed normal before the match this was taken in 1997 in toronto . and i am pretty sure his boots cant have that much padding, but i could be wrong 

:How tall would that make Kevin Nash? Or Paul Wright? I personally think that Undie is not even 6 ft 8 in, but it is more accurate than 6 ft 11 in I think.([[User:Halbared|Halbared]] 07:18, 4 June 2006 (UTC))

P.S. I recommend this Undertaker website to everyone, it is one of the best Undertaker websites you'll find and your ultimate #1 Undertaker resource on the Intetnet. [[User:Luke Edhouse|Luke Edhouse]] 00:11, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

Luke, stop plugging that stupid phenom site on here. How the hell would they know any of his &quot;true&quot; stats anyhow? .[[User:Undertakerlives|Undertakerlives]]

Actually The Undertaker is 6'11 305 lbs. I had a picture with him at the Wrestlemania Rage party the day before Wrestlemania XV and he was clearly a foot taller than i was. Back in 1998, They billed the Undertaker as 7 feet 328 lbs. But his correct height is 6'11. He's definitly not 6'5 because Test is 6'7-6'8 and when Undertaker fought him at Summerslam 2002, he was about 4 inches taller. If you actually saw when The Great Khali and The Undertaker stood face to face, you can tell Khali was 4 inches taller at 7'3. This person needs to get his facts straight

:Test is not more than 6 ft 5 in. I estimate that Undie is not above 6 ft 7 in.([[User:Halbared|Halbared]] 14:34, 16 June 2006 (UTC))

It makes me sick how people over-estimate the kayfabe of wrestler's heights. Undertaker is 6'8&quot;, not 6'5. Kane (Glen Jacobs) is about the same height. Kevin Nash is 6'11&quot;- legitimately, check out the NCAA acrchives and look at the 1979-1980 Tennessee Volunteers (Nash played center, which means he would have to be pretty tall). Back to Undertaker (who also played college ball) he is 6'8&quot;. As stated above, he quite possibly may be a bit taller than 6'8&quot;, as he isn't completely dwarfed by the Great Khali (who is a legit 7'2 or 3).

I've analyzed some of his pictures... I estimate his height at somewhere around 6'6''

I wish WWE would give his actual height and not the height with the padding in his boots! It confuses people.

He's 6'8, they say it in his biography on the very first page. They say he's 6'8. There's no way he's 6'5.

He's about 6'9 1/2 or a legit 6'10. Look at him when he came face to face with Khali for the first time, they were very close to being eye to eye. 'Taker has to be at least 6'9 &amp; some inches.
[[User:Son of Kong|Son of Kong]] 33:7 3 August 2006

It's clear from reading all this that no one knows the undertaker's height or his weight for that matter. People are positive about so many things so since you're all thinking something different in regards to his height and his weight because he doesn't keep changing from 6'5 6'9 6'7, etc. Why don't you all just agree to disagree and go back to what the WWE originally states him as being 6'10 and 328 pounds

I agree that 'Taker is 6'10 but he is NOT 328 lbs. If he was he'd be fat but he's not. He's only around 285-305 lbs.

I found a picture of Calaway face to face with Kane when he first became the ''American Badass'' &amp; he had an inch over Kane. As the ''American Badass'' he more than likely didn't wear shoe lifts so he definitely has to be taller than Kane.

The Undertaker is 6'8&quot;. everyone argues about wrestlers height and weight. Brock Lesnar is 6'4&quot;, Kane is 6'8&quot; he wears lifts. Batista is 6'5&quot;. End of the height disscusion.

Like I said, he is 6'10, 328 pounds. It's done people. please. end it. leave it at that. As soon as a girl came up behind me and started arguing about 328 being fat, the arguing started up again. Just end it. [[User:Tonetare|Tonetare]] 22:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

Calaway is 6'10 because when Jacobs was Isaac Yankem &amp; they fought Calaway had an inch on him. Jacobs has said that he's about 6'9 so he was probably wearing lifts he was about 6'10 but Calaway wore lifts making him a half an inch taller. So, leave his height at 6'10 &amp; his weight is 300lbs, nothing more, nothing less. [[User:Son of Kong|Son of Kong]]

I agree with you Son Of Kong. [[User:Tonetare|Tonetare]] 22:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

Let's just leave it at 6'10 or 6'9. [[User:Son of Kong|Son of Kong]]

:No, it's been discussed to death already. He played center in college basketball, and thus his height at the time is a matter of public record, at 6' 8&quot;. While some people do continue to grow after the age when they'd be in college, it is generally an inch, at the most. His weight is around 305, based on his build and how much of it appears to be muscle. -[[User:Darryl Hamlin|Darryl Hamlin]] 07:34, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

Although I agree with the height, I'd say that his weight varies from 285-298. [[User:Son of Kong|Son of Kong]]

==Birth date==


The last editor has sent detailed information to verify the change of birth date which is quoted (incorrectly) as 1962 by several sources including IMDb.  I won't paste his email here, but the information is available if needed.  I've also invited him to this page to add any comments that would help.  -- [[User:Sannse|sannse]] [[User talk:Sannse|(talk)]] 22:45, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)



The information [[User:Sannse|sannse]] is refering to is an e-mail which was sent to me from the website administrator at Waltrip High School's website, the high school which Calaway attended as a teenager. The webmaster confirmed details that Mark's surname is spelt &quot;Calaway&quot; (note: just one 'L') and that he graduated from the Class of 1983 aged 18, born March 24, 1965. As [[User:Sannse|sannse]] said, whilst the information is not posted here but it is indeed available if needed.  -- [[User:Luke Edhouse|Luke Edhouse]] 01:31, 28 Jan 2005


The original e-mail correspondance sent and received between myself and the Webmaster of Waltrip High School's website which outlines and confirms Mark Calaway's name spelling and date of birth is below:

I stand corrected. The correct spelling is indeed Calaway. I was a metal shop teacher at the time and had him in my class. He was a real quiet but pleasant kid. As far as his age you are correct to guess that he would have been 18 at his graduation in 1983. So yes he must have been born in March 1965.

Original Message

From: LukeEdhouse@aol.com Sent: Monday, September 27, 2004 9:04 AM To: Lipham, Richard W Subject: Waltrip High School Website


Dear Webmaster

I was reading the Waltrip High School website and on the Waltrip Trivia page, I came across this:

&quot;The professional wrestler known as The Undertaker graduated from Waltrip in 1983 as Mark Calloway. He was a member of the basketball team.&quot;

I knew that &quot;The Undertaker&quot; had attended Waltrip High School and I've researched and written some information for a # 1 Biography site and Internet resoucre on the Undertaker/Mark Calaway www.Undertaker-WWE.com

One thing I wanted to query is that I was under the impression that his surname was spelt 'Calaway' not 'Calloway' i.e. you said that he graduated as 'Mark Calloway' in 1983 but in the basketball team photo you have put on site, his surname is listed as 'Calaway'. Would you be able to clear up any confusion on that matter at all?

Also, lastly, if Mark Calaway graduated from Waltrip in 1983, does that mean he was 18-years-old in 1983, i.e. born in 1965?

Any information you would be able to respond to would be fantastic and greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely,

Luke Edhouse

== Sit up sig move? ==

I was just wondering since only Undertaker and Kane get up from being knocked down by chair shots etc in the 'sit up' manner could it be considered a signature move? Or for that would it have to be an actual 'attack'? [[User: Night_Bringer|Night Bringer]]

Wel, it is a signiture of his, and he does move... so I reckon it could be a signiture move. Hes famous for it.[[User:Emi211|Emi211]] 06:49, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== An update on the date of birth issue ==

I sent IMDb.com the detailed and reliable information on Mark Calaway's date of birth being March 24, 1965 and NOT 1962 but they aren't interested. So, a note to all readers of this page would be to just ignore IMDb's date of birth entry because, A. Not only is it wrong, but, B. They are unwilling to change it, as you can from the message they sent to me below:

Hello 

Thanks for your message. 

There are many 'official' sources giving different dates of birth for Mark, however we are satisfied that ours is correct and will not be changing it unless we receive communication from Mark himself. 

Many thanks

: What's your source that's more accurate than theirs? [[User:NightShade|NightShade]] 01:41, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

:: Well, IMDb even told me that their information wasn't gained from either Mark Calaway or the WWE, but is the information as posted by an IMDb member. There are lots of sources to corroborate that Calaway was born in 1965, do you want me to list them all here? For a start, he was 18 when he grdauated from Waltrip High School in 1983, do the math and you can work out what year hw would have been born. The evidence/source for that statement has already been posted on this discussion page. [[User:Luke Edhouse|Luke Edhouse]] 23:36, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

== Comment ==
Hello, I thought I'd like to add my own bit to the mystique that is Undertaker.

The Undertaker is one of the Only WWE Characters (Then the WWF), to act in a Bollywood movie, Khiladiyon Ke Khiladi.

The actor Akshay Kumar, who is a martial arts exponent, is said to have hurt his back while lifting Undertaker high in the air, apparently for a extended bodyslam. Akshay Kumar was out of business, for six months.
:I'm not sure why you posted this on the talk page. Do you want to add this to the article?  --[[User:Chrysaor|Chrysaor]] June 30, 2005 21:36 (UTC)


This is incorrect.  According to Percy Pringle III the real Undertaker, Mark Calaway, did NOT appear in that movie.  It was a faker and was falsely billed. [[Dragon]] December 24, 2005

The base move of Old School is Flying Shoulder Breaker, not Flying Clothesline. It does look like Flying Clothesline but in fact the Undertaker is targetting the shoulder blades instead of the back of neck. And after he does the move, sometimes the victim would grab his shoulder and stalk in pain.

yeah is the undertaker a bjj studier too? [[bjj07]]

== Article size ==
I see that Undertaker's article, and the articles of other WWE superstars get constantly updated, pretty much after every RAW or Smackdown show, not to mention PPV's. Should we really do it? The article is gargantuan as it is now, and I don't think that Taker's feud with Orton should be described with every new development of it... I think that all of those articles should be trimmed. ([[User:DuDe|DuDe]])
:what i noticed (which i also do) after some time people shorten the paragraphs as they type up new ones

add back the info and stop making the decade of destruction years so short. it's irritating and it's missing major events

YO DUDE, I agree with you. Before it had undertaker started off as wrestler with purple boot spats knee high boots and a stetson bowler hat. Some fool got rid of that and shortened the whole decade of destruction years. And in addition, all this information is a SPOILER and there a rules about spoilers and spoiling these events. It shouldn't have whetehr Taker won or lost as that could spoil the event and there are also people spoilign recent Undertaker matches. They come on here and write what exactly happened on smackdown because it occured on Tuesday and airs on Friday and they spoil it for me and lots of other users. This article just need to stick to who the Undertaker is. Describe his wrestling character (how it includes mind games, how he enters, how he is scary etc.), all of his different outfits and hairstyles, wrestling moves, his different music. Not all this continually updated info and spoiling info.

I think that only important matches in his career and ppv matches should be put in, which isnt alot, this would considerably shorten the article size.

== Last Name Spelling==
This is a point I feel great need to redress. In ''Journey into Darkness'', Mark's last name is spelled Callaway. Given that the book was published by WWE books, and the fact that the WWE obviously had some control over this, I feel that continuously removing my edit that pointsa out that the double l spelling of Callaway may be accurate to be in poor taste and I ask that it be stopped. -- [[User: Warwolf|Warwolf]]
:This has been addressed here before. See the e-mail exchange at the beginning of the talk page - that pretty much settled the matter about the spelling. Just because the book is published by WWE, doesn't mean that the facts presented in it hold any water. ''Tales from Wrescal Lane'' and ''Mick Foley's Christmas Chaos'' were published by WWE as well - that doesn't mean we can make inferences based on them. If ''Journey into Darkness'' was a real-life biography, then it would be a more authoritative source. Considering that this book is a fictional account about the history of the Kane and Undertaker characters, it's not a good idea to make inferences based on it. --[[User:Jtalledo|Jtalledo]] [[User_talk:Jtalledo|(talk)]] 04:02, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

:::Well, I assumed it was settled considering no one has changed the blurb about the other spellings being incorrect. Look at the [http://hs.houstonisd.org/WaltripHS/TriviaFolder/calaway_team.jpg Yearbook photo]. A real high school yearbook is far more reliable than a work of fiction. Despite being published by WWE, the book on Kane has its share of continuity problems with WWE storylines (''See'' [[Glen Jacobs#Journey into Darkness]]). If we want to continue to speculate, the author may have also misspelled the name as well. I'll take the word of someone who actually had the guy in his class and a high school yearbook over using speculation about a work of fiction. --[[User:Jtalledo|Jtalledo]] [[User_talk:Jtalledo|(talk)]] 16:24, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::To be perfectly honest, people can argue about the surname spelling issue as much as they want. I accept the fact that in several WWE affiliated publications Calaway's name has actually been spelt &quot;Callaway&quot;, I'm not sure why that is. I could list a whole number of instances where is has been spelt &quot;Calaway&quot;, whether it be on the closing credits of the 1991 movie &quot;Suburban Commando&quot;, on the A&amp;E Biography documentary on Mick Foley, on Percy Pringle's official website, his father's obituary in the Houston Chronicle newspaper, his High School Yearbook basketball team photo, the original e-mail from the Waltrip High School website administrator who was also one of Calaway's teachers who checked records to confirm the information. Right, I've listed all of my sources, not that it's made me feel any better. If you want to dispute the name spelling then do so, I have just as many reasonably reliable sources of information as other people claim to. There will be cynical people who will probably laugh or throw accusations of lying, but the less immature people who will have the decency to believe that I am not immature enough to lie over something so trivial may be interested to know I have a friend in the United States who has also checked official records of registered births in 1965 in Houston, Texas and &quot;Mark Calaway&quot; spelt &quot;Calaway&quot; (born March 24, 1965, father Frank and mother Catherine) is one of the names listed. Why the spelling of &quot;Callaway&quot; crops up in certain WWE related material I do not know, just as I do not know why some people also reference and claim &quot;Calloway&quot; to be the correct spelling when it is not.

The same issue exists with his date of birth which has been listed as March 24, 1962 since the profile was first set up and information was added by, yes, you guessed it, just a fan. I have contacted them several times with the supporting evidence I have to corroborate that Calaway's birth name indeed only contains one L, that there is no documented or substantiated proof that his middle name is Lucas and that it is in fact Mark William Calaway according to official birth records for Houston, Texas in 1965 and that he was born in 1965 not 1962 but they refuse to change it and say they are no longer accepting edits to Mark Calaway's personal details unless they come from Mark himself or his agent.

The name used for Mark Calaway at Survivor Series 1990 was '''The Undertaker''' [http://www.youtube.com/?v=7VnSFEb-Ip0].  For a brief time in late 1990/early 1991, he was billed on WWF TV as '''Kane, The Undertaker'''. The &quot;Kane&quot; portion was dropped after Brother Love was replaced as his manager by Paul Bearer. - [[User:Chadbryant|Chadbryant]] 20:17, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

I'll back up Chad. It was just &quot;The Undertaker&quot; at SS. I checked the video today.
[[User:BoosterBronze|BoosterBronze]] 20:51, 28 March 2006 (UTC)BoosterBronze

Nope. The Ring Announcer said &quot;Kane, The Undertaker&quot; http://youtube.com/watch?v=dAK6jrjp1Ko
Proof's in the pudding.

Both videos have been removed at YouTube, but I can assure you he was introduced as &quot;The Undertaker&quot; at Survivor Series.  If the second video had a ring announcer announcing him as &quot;Kane the Undertaker&quot;, it could not have been at his debut.  He was not introduced by a ring announcer; he was introduced by Ted DiBiase on the house mic.  I have it on tape, and DiBiase clearly says: &quot;I give you: THE UNDERTAKER!&quot;  He was, for a short time thereafter, billed as &quot;Kane the Undertaker&quot; (as others have stated); so if the video has an announcer introducing him that way, it was from a smaller show after the Survivor Series. [[User:Tuckdogg|Tuckdogg]] 04:16, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

:Update: Link to his Debut: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQbX13hDTLo&amp;search=undertaker.  Link will probably be dead before long.  Just search for &quot;Undertaker&quot; at YouTube and you can generally find it posted somewhere.  If it's not an introduction by Ted DiBiase (with commentary by Gorilla Monsoon and Roddy Piper), it's the wrong video. [[User:Tuckdogg|Tuckdogg]] 04:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

:His debut DID refer to him as just The Undertaker but he WAS referred to as Kane, The Undertaker early in his career.

However, I remember watching a copy of Survivor Series from The Undertaker's debut and Ted DiBiase says &quot;Kane, The Undertaker&quot; and it brought memories of Poltergeist into my brain.  A few years later, I watched the actual video tape produced by the WWF/WWE and the name &quot;Kane&quot; had been edited out.  Too bad the videos on YouTube have been removed.  I hope someone can find extra proof of this.

Who summarized the decade of destruction years? It had so much good info before. This section of this article from 1990 to 1999 (The decade of destruction years) has been summarized way to small. There are major events in those years that are not mentioned and in the part about the first inferno, the summarizer didn't even announce the winner. Add back the info and stop shortening it so unreasonably like you have. How rude to keep getting rid of so much of someone's research

:Yes, Chasey and Gracie are indeed the names of his two daughters with his wife Sara. He does have another child from his previous marriage, a son, born in 1994. Some websites and other sources report that Calaway has two sons from his first marriage, but there is only documented evidence for him having one son and when Percy Pringle (aka Paul Bearer) was once asked about this, he stated that the Undertaker has only one son from his marriage to ex-wife Jodi Lynn. [[User:Luke Edhouse|Luke Edhouse]] 01:57, 1 April 2006

Thanks! Do you know the name of his son? [[User:MgHoneyBee]] Apr.2,2006

I'm pretty sure his son's name is Gunner. [[User:Undertakerlives]]

I'm not 100% sure of his son's name. Some websites report him having two sons, but I've only been made aware of one son, which was information shared by Percy Pringle (Paul Bearer). The only site to list a name for his son(s) has been IMDb.com, others have since copied the information and put it on their own websites. I would agree with [[User:Undertakerlives]] and say that his son's name is Gunner, but due to the rather unreliable nature of IMDd.com's information regarding Mark Calaway has come to light, I can't back that up.

== Name change ==

Can't we move the article to '''The Undertaker''' for the same reasons as Triple H, Steve Austin, and The Rock? He ''has'' spent 16 years under that same ring name. [[User:Maestro25|Maestro25]] 01:21, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

I agree. The Undertaker, like the wrestlers stated above, has trancended his fame to beyond the ring.

== Name varification ==

I do not think that the WWE is lieing about his name The Undertaker but his real name is Mark Calloway because I tried to look him up under that name it poped up a lot of stuff on him and now they have changed his birth name. Furthermore, I know they can lie about the weight but I could see them making a mistake on the height though but I do not think that doctors know everything to the absolute fact on height and weight. If anybody has something to say you can email it to me under TripleTrinity06@sbcglobal.net or if you guys have a way to contact Mark himself give me a contact based upon his email or what not!

:Actually, the information about the spelling on his name was obtained in an e-mail exchange with one of his high school teachers. It's posted here on the talk page if you'd like to see it yourself. As for height and weight, a variety of sources are used. For example, Powerslam magazine, which is less likely to use [[Kayfabe|kayfabe]] heights than sources like WWE.com. Another source is people who go to see live events, where they can properly compare heights of wrestlers, and themselves.

I stand corrected. The correct spelling is indeed Calaway. I was a metal shop teacher at the time and had him in my class. He was a real quiet but pleasant kid. As far as his age you are correct to guess that he would have been 18 at his graduation in 1983. So yes he must have been born in March 1965.

Dear Webmaster

I was reading the Waltrip High School website and on the Waltrip Trivia page, I came across this:

&quot;The professional wrestler known as The Undertaker graduated from Waltrip in 1983 as Mark Calloway. He was a member of the basketball team.&quot;

I knew that &quot;The Undertaker&quot; had attended Waltrip High School and I've researched and written some information for a # 1 Biography site and Internet resoucre on the Undertaker/Mark Calaway www.Undertaker-WWE.com

One thing I wanted to query is that I was under the impression that his surname was spelt 'Calaway' not 'Calloway' i.e. you said that he graduated as 'Mark Calloway' in 1983 but in the basketball team photo you have put on site, his surname is listed as 'Calaway'. Would you be able to clear up any confusion on that matter at all?

Also, lastly, if Mark Calaway graduated from Waltrip in 1983, does that mean he was 18-years-old in 1983, i.e. born in 1965?

Any information you would be able to respond to would be fantastic and greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely,

:*'''Comment''': That depends on your viewpoint of things.  My point (and the point others have made) is that, with wrestlers, there is a disconnect between the character (Undertaker) and the man playing him (Mark Calaway).  They're acting, and their characters are not really any different than characters played by anyone else on TV.  Kurt Angle is not really an arrogant prick; Mark Calaway is not an animated corpse; Mark Henry is not actually a 400lb. sex addict.  They're just playing characters.  The articles written here, for the most part, are not about the history of the character.  The articles are about the man (or woman) behind the character.  Sometimes, like with Kurt Angle or Mark Henry, the character name and real name are the same, so there isn't really a problem.  When they're not, such as here, the article should be indexed under the real name, since that's the focus of the article.  If someone wants to write a kayfabe article discussing the history of The Undertaker from a storyline perspective, I'd wholeheartedly endorse putting that under &quot;Undertaker (wrestling)&quot;.  But an article that discusses Mark Calaway's marriage, his children, his past in WCW and the characters he played there, etc. should not be indexed under &quot;Undertaker&quot; because it's not about that character.  It's about Calaway the man, and should be under his own name.  Just because other wrestlers customarily call someone by a readily recognizable character name ('Taker for Calaway, Cactus for Mick Foley, etc.) doesn't mean we need to ignore Wikipedia's status as an encyclopedic resource.

:*'''Comment''': Oh, (duh), Snoop Doog.  There's a difference between a stage name and a character name.  Snoop Dogg selected that name for his rapping because it was more interesting than his own name.  Nothing has changed about him, he just signs a different name.  It's like an author using a pen name; same person, different name.  They aren't playing a role, they've just changed their name for the public.  Wrestlers, on the other hand, are playing characters.  They act out the roles they've been given on television for entertainment purposes.  These may sometimes closely resemble their real life personalities, but they are just taking the actions the script writers tell them to.  Snoop can't go on MTV, shoot someone, and then tell the cops, &quot;Dude, that was just my character Snoop.  I was acting!&quot;  Mark Calaway can dress up like a zombie and bury his opponents in caskets and no one thinks, &quot;Man, that Mark Calaway guy is strange.&quot;  The actions are atributed to the character, not the man.  That's the disconnect, and that's why the vast majority of wrestlers should not be indexed under their character names. [[User:Tuckdogg|Tuckdogg]] 22:44, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

===Discussion===
:''Add any additional comments''
Personally, I really don't think it's that important. If you search for &quot;The Undertaker&quot; it redirects you straight to the Mark Calaway page anyway. Although &quot;The Undertaker&quot; is the name Calaway is best known by, some would argue that it is common for most professional wrestlers' Wikipedia pages to be listed under their real names. Some may also argue that the pre-WWE career, biographical and personal information pertain to the man Mark Calaway as opposed to just the Undertaker character. I personally believe it's fine leaving it as Mark Calaway with a redirect from The Undertaker, but if majority of people here really want it changed to The Undertaker, then sobeit, I'll support that decision simply because I don't really care that much to be honest. [[User:Luke Edhouse|Luke Edhouse]] 01:54, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
:It is important - putting it at &quot;The Undertaker&quot; gives a little too much creedence to [[kayfabe]], when we should be focusing the real man himself. There's a smaller gap between say, [[Chris Jericho]] and Chris Irvine than Undertaker and Mark Calaway. The Undertaker is an undead, supernatural character while Mark Calaway is a mortal guy. While the &quot;American Badass&quot; gimmick shortened the gap somewhat, he's returned to old character since and will mainly be associated with that gimmick. This is why I oppose the move. --[[User:Jtalledo|Jtalledo]] [[User_talk:Jtalledo|(talk)]] 20:05, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
::On a related note - this was raised with Chris Jericho and someone proposing to move it to Chris Irvine. It didn't apply there because the gap between the character and real life wasn't as large, but moving Mark Calaway to the Undertaker would sort of be like moving [[Patrick Stewart]] to [[Jean-Luc Picard]]. --[[User:Jtalledo|Jtalledo]] [[User_talk:Jtalledo|(talk)]] 20:08, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

:::A wrestling gimmick is different than a part played by an actor.

::::Yes, wrestling gimmicks are different from actors, but they still shouldn't be confused with each other. Those other cases are exceptions, where the distinction doesn't matter as much. However, I hold that the difference between &quot;The Undertaker&quot; and Mark Calaway&quot; is extremely large - particularly because because the Undertaker is an &quot;undead&quot; character while Calaway is regular man. --[[User:Jtalledo|Jtalledo]] [[User_talk:Jtalledo|(talk)]] 13:33, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
::::: I disagree; wrestling characters are EXACTLY like other TV characters played by actors.  The only difference is that wrestling used to try and maintain kayfabe.  Kayfabe is largely dead now; the only real vestiges of it remaining is the tendency to refer to the wrestlers by their character names instead of their real names (e.g. most other wrestlers call Mick Foley &quot;Cactus&quot; instead of Mick).  The two should be kept separate in an encyclopedic resource.  Check out imdb.com, another reference site, which indexes all wrestlers under their real names and lists their stage names as the &quot;characters&quot; they play on TV (as it should).   I don't consider this an issue of indexing them under their &quot;most commonly known name&quot;, because the character and the person playing them are completely different (even if we confuse them).  I read an interview with a wrestler once that summed the distinction up perfectly: &quot;Steve Austin is the one on TV raising hell.  Steve Williams cashes the paychecks.&quot; [[User:Tuckdogg|Tuckdogg]] 01:20, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

If I remember correctly, Cain was the correct spelling of the name when he was wrestling early on in the WWF/E. They just recycled it with the spelling &quot;Kane&quot; for Glen Jacobs.

::Well what I say isn't the be all and end all obviously, but I've never come across any videos where the Undertaker's name was spelt &quot;Cain the Undertaker&quot;, I've only ever seen one which said &quot;Kane the Undertaker&quot;, however, even when the ring announcer would announce him as &quot;Kane the Undertaker&quot; most of the time his name flashed up as just &quot;The Undertaker&quot;. The only thing I will say about the Ludwig/Ludvig example, is that's a more commonly occuring spelling variation of the name because of the name's origin. However, another example of this would be Dennis Knight's name Midian/Mideon - WWE used &quot;Midian&quot; before deciding to go with the &quot;Mideon&quot; spelling. Anyway, &quot;Kane the Undertaker&quot; was the only trademark name that WWE registered in 1990, they never filed a &quot;Cain the Undertaker&quot; trademark. P.S.

His WWF/WWE debut was as the Surprise Partner for Ted DiBiase's team during Survivor Series 1990.  The actual title line on the screen was &quot;Kane, The Undertaker&quot;.  I saw this on PPV and then my local stations stopped carrying wrestling for a month.  When they brought it back, &quot;Kane&quot; had been dropped, so I was confused.

I found this link verifying the use of the name &quot;Kane, The Undertaker&quot;
http://www.wrestleview.com/info/faq/undertaker.shtml
If someone can show me how to link it into the main page or do it for me, it'd be appreciated.  Until someone proves me wrong about this, please stop changing the info on the main page.

You both are right -- I have (or had) a few early matches of the Undertaker, and in one of them the title on the screen was &quot;Cain the Undertaker&quot;.  Not sure when they used &quot;Kane the Undertaker&quot;, but in any case, both names were only used briefly.  -ZW

== Locking the article ==
I REALLY think this article should be locked. Some stupid fanboys keep adding the most irrevelent of details, like the color eyeliner, boots, and tights he wears on what seems like a week by week basis. Furthermore, the article keep reverting to a tone that makes it sound like it was written by the 5 year old son of a WWE writer (ie: &quot;It was at Royal Rumble where the Undertaker would would face the most feared wrestler in the world, the 7-foot beast known as Kane, in a match that can only be described as sickening: The Hell in a Cell. Such a twisted structure had seen the most brutal of fights, bla bla bla.....!!!&quot;) And the version of the article that keeps being reverted to is not separated into paragraphs, but rather blocks of text that span multiple pages and don't have any subtitles/divisions. This is all fine and dandy if you run a fanboy website, but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia. It would probably be in everyone's best interest if we prevented these people from editing the article anymore. [[User:Y2kcrazyjoker|Y2kcrazyjoker]] 05:34, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

Also, there are hadly any pictures of him in his character. Whatever happpened to the thing that was on here a while back which had the various stages of his character, from original all the way through to the appearance he uses now, it had step by step pictures. I feel this needs to be introduced on this page once again.

The Tombstone piledriver is not just his signature move. Kane used it all the time along time ago. Justin Credible and Andre the Giant also used this moved but it was not called the Tombstone. Now Old School, Ive never seen anyone else use that move. So, if you can find anyone else that has used that move then please tell me. So, therefore since no one else uses old school it is the Undertakers signature move. So that picture is better to have than the tombstone one.

How is the old school pic free use? It looks like it was takin at a tribute to the troops. the copyright still belongs to WWE. And if someone in the crowd took the pic, its original research.

Also, please sign your posts on talk pages by appending &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. -[[User:Darryl Hamlin|Darryl Hamlin]] 03:51, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Undertaker is practically the only person who uses the Tombstone frequently, ok Orton tries it at times and Kane uses it occasionally but no where near as much as Taker and if you ask most WWE fans 'who uses the piledriver?' they'll pry say Taker and they'll definitely say Taker if you mention the word 'Tombstone'. Therefore it's his signature finishing move, and Old School is too complicated a move to have a pic showing, also in most pages we don't have pics of signature moves only Finshers. So about you look for a free image of Taker using the Chokeslam, his other main finisher, instead of pushing your opinion that Old School should be pictured? 
[[User:Night_Bringer|Night Bringer]] 13:46, 19th August 2006 (GMT +10)

K first of all, chill out man. Second, I want a pic of the Tombstone as well. It's his main finish. The Old School is not his main move. I'm not pushing to show a pic of old school. I'm on your side.

:: Ive added it, we need more pics, this article is pretty boring just solid text...

::: Wikipolicy stands, unless you find a free use image of his chokeslam or piledriver don't put in a pic regardless of how boring the article seems. This is the way we're approaching all WWE stars pages now. [[User:Night_Bringer|Night Bringer]] 21:51, 12th September 2006 (GMT +10)

== Undertaker match on Smack Down ==

Undertaker vs. Khali is a pay-per-view match, but it was aired on Smack Down. I think this should happen more often because announcer's are always crowing and dramatizing about him being the biggest star on smackdown, yet he rarely ever even shows up. It's like he is not a smackdown superstar so why crow about him being one. this year his part-time self, he's had 2 matches on smackdown and another thing, he named his son Gunner. uhhh, does anyone find that a little out there? He WAS my favorite wrestler in the 90s not so much afterward. He used to do the Dark Side character to a T, now you can tell even by his eye-contact, he is just not as good as doing that character [[User:Tonetare|Tonetare]] 22:09, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

First, I know people that have the name Gunner. So whats the point of making fun of it on Wikipedia. Also, the Undertaker gets to be called the best superstar on SmackDown! because of his reputation. From all the matches he has had since 1990. So thats why he gets the dramatization from the commentators. --[[User:Mikedk9109|Mikedk9109]] 22:23, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

So if you knew to people named Killer too, that wouldn't make the name sound anymore decent. And the Undertaker was good once upon a time. Let's not encourage is part-time and absent behavior by crowing about him and dramatizing about him. Let's control ourselves a little bit so that he knows he isn't doing anything special. He is getting more respect right now what with the absences than when he was in the 90s when wrestled on a weekly basis, so he'll probably keep to the absences now. He's probably like, 'oh well, their still going nuts. I guess I can break every 4 months after wrestling two weeks. [[User:Tonetare|Tonetare]] 04:34, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

Yeah, that is kind of true. --[[User:Mikedk9109|Mikedk9109]] 15:46, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

Great contributions SKRIBUL, however behave yourself with respect to inappropriate posts like the one above. Work on getting your point over respectfully. Thank you! [[User:Tonetare|Tonetare]] 23:03, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

: Sorry - I will try to be more respectfull in the future. [[User:SKRIBUL|SKRIBUL]] 18:54, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

I respectfully call Tonetare's remarks bollocks. Anyway, I doubt that the discussion place for this particular wiki is the space where you should start venting your personal opinion, plenty of fora around where you can do that.
Respectfully yours, Dave.


Bollocks?! speak english. This is the exact place to be venting your opinion being a discussion page. Not to mention the fact that you just vented yours which makes you kind of a hypocrite. But anyway, you really made no sense because nothing you said proved why Undertaker shouldn't be getting so much over-exaggerated praise weekly. You really proved my point that he shouldn't be. Undertaker works part time you said, but is still the locker room leader you said. Thank you for that. Everyone crows on and on about him when he barely ever shows up. They really shouldn't do this. He must be saying to himself, hey part-time keeps them this happy, then I guess I can stick with this plan. And you say Undertaker's had great matches. So has Shawn Michaels every week on RAW, so has Cena every week on Raw but they aren't getting nearly as much overexaggerated praise as the Undertaker. [[User:TareTone|TareTone]] 04:42, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

: Please, get off your high horse. Your opinion is noted but simply not relevant. The rules clearly state: &quot;This is not a forum for general discussion about the article's subject&quot;. And you are correct to say that I shouldn't either, so I removed that portion of my previous post.
: Keep the remarks here limited to the content and form of the article. You might want to check out a site like paulnemer.com for discussion about wrestling.
:And for your information, bollocks is in the English dictionairy, you might want to refresh your knowledge a bit. [[User:211.206.122.35|211.206.122.35]] 08:16, 13 September 2006 (UTC)Dave

Doesn't matter if it's in the english dictionary. You didn't use it in the way it's used in english, so that's why I said speak english. Never said use words in our dictionary there, big guy. And how am I on a high horse and being arrogant by telling you my opinions and how what you said just makes a good argument for what I said. I guess that's an 'oh phooey you're right' kinda thing. Anyway, I'm glad you erased your hypocritical remarks. [[User:TareTone|TareTone]] 17:12, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

: Only real losers start nitpicking about grammar when they can't come up with better arguments, Taretone. Anyway, Dave has a point. You are entitled to your opinion, ''but the fact that thousands and thousands of wrestling fans still mark out for The Undertaker, that despite his few appearances he is still one of the bigger draws in the WWE, that alone proves you wrong''. Or do you have the arrogance to claim that all those thousands of The Undertaker fans are wrong and you are right? Just like all those thousands and thousands of Hulkamaniacs are wrong for marking out for Hogan despite his sporadic appearances and lacklustre performance?
No one every claimed that The Undertaker is the most proficient wrestler in the world, but very few dispute that second to Andre the Giant he is the best big man ever, that he is the ultimate gimmick in Wrestling Entertainment and that already during his active career he is a wrestling legend. The fact that you disagree with this is fine, but fact remains that thousands and thousands of wrestling fans do agree and more importantly, his peers seem to think the same.
The fact that he works part time is completely irrelevant. I myself am 6&quot;4 (i have wrestled in the independent circuit myself, though not very successful I hasten to add ;) ). At a certain time I was ordered by my doctor to loose weight because of the enormous stress on my joints. Now Calaway is taller than I am, and also heavier, so combined with the high quantity of appearances, his 16 years must have been murder on his body. And fact remains that Calaway is due for a hip replacement. So working part time is only smart and justified, unless workers need to be addicted to painkillers or cripple in order to get your praise? So pout all you want, the man has paid his dues and gets the respect and praise he fully deserves. [[User:84.81.226.215|84.81.226.215]] 20:13, 14 September 2006 (UTC)Marcello

I don't feel like reading all of what you said for a couple of reasons. I stopped after the first two lines.  It's too damn long. Keep it short. And also because you gave me a bad argument to the whole discussion about bollocks, that is you resorted to childish name-calling. But the point at which I stopped reading was that baloney sentence in which you acted like someone else. Anyway, I may give you the respect of reading if you keep your response short and simple. bye! [[User:TareTone|TareTone]] 04:23, 15 September 2006 (UTC)


Sure kid, i do hope you can handle real life discussions better than online where you avoid responding to arguments and opinions that undermine your ramblings. The virtual equivalent of a little baby covering the ears and chanting lalalala in loud voice to avoid hearing the ugly truth.
Anyway, read the Wikipedia rules: this is not the place for discussions about the topic, only about the article. That cannot be so difficult to grasp? Same goes for Marcello and others. '''Please keep these kind of discussions limited to wrestling fora like www.wrestleview.com, this is the place for article related discussion!!!'''

Hopefully, no jerks will change it. You never know on wikipedia.  [[User:Tonetare|Tonetare]] 23:00, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

Who removed SKRBUL's picture of the Undertaker? The other one was much better in my opinion. Although the page is Mark Calaway. It is not called American Badass or Undertaker. If that were the title maybe your picture would have lasted SKRBUL. I don't really know why the name is called Mark Calaway as he is not famous for being Mark Calaway. He is famous for being the Undertaker just as Booker-T's name is under Booker-T and not his actual name. [[User:Tonetare|Tonetare]] 14:25, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

== Undertaker Vs The Undertaker ==

WWE.com has changed Mark's superstar page to &quot;Undertaker&quot; from &quot;The Undertaker&quot; - &quot;Undertaker&quot; is not linked to this page only &quot;The Undertaker&quot; is, meaning people typing in &quot;Undertaker&quot; are being redirected to &quot;Funaral Director&quot; [[User:SKRIBUL|SKRIBUL]] 18:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

If you were referring to the domain each domain costs money and WWE does not officially support domains for any of its superstars now, that particular domain, I think you mean theundertaker.com I BELIEVE is left over for when they did have them for their bigger stars in the Attitude era. The point is officially you should use the full WWE.com address e.g. wwe.com/superstars/smackdown/so-and-so. [[User:BMSprint]] 02:43, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

== Undertake and making appearances on other shows ==
How come the Undertaker never appears on the Late Night Show, Conan, Saturday Night Live, etc. like a lot of the other Main Event wrestlers sometimes do?

It doesn't fit his character. For sure part of the reason why his character excels in longetivity. - Dave

Why doesn't it fit his career? Wouldn't more people come to know him and he would get more popular, like Hulk Hogan did. I mean, I've seen Randy Orton on one of those late night talk shows and his career hasn't gone on nearly as long as the Undertaker's. Why can't the lights go out on the late night show, smoke arise, the Undertaker brings the lights back. And it could be real funny. that guy with the big-ass chin is really scared as he is asking Taker questions. He doesn't understand a word the Undertaker is saying because Undertaker's like &quot;For life has no purpose without the dawning of the dead.  They whome fear do not seek the eyes of those&quot; and stuff. And J Leno is just like &quot;whaaaaaaat? uhhh yeeaaaa' I mean, it could be so hilarious. Why hasn't Taker done this? frankly, I just think he hasn't thought of this idea before. It could be similar to what the Ultimate Warrior did on R Cineo Hall or however you spell it [[User:TareTone|TareTone]] 04:31, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

:Two points, TareTone. One, it might fit his career, but it wouldn't fit his '''character'''. The Deadman gimmick doesn't work with going on Leno. Two, it's spelled Arsenio Hall. -[[User:Darryl Hamlin|Darryl Hamlin]] 21:33, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

:judging from the pretty ignorant comments, Taretone is either 15 or a troll. And FYI, Undertaker has done a few talkshow appearances in his first 2 years of his WWE career. The fact that he 'doesn't do talkshows' has the same reason as why you won't see him during tribute shows. The WWE protects his image like a mother lion her cubs.
For a character that has risen repeatedly from the death, who can let lightning strike (..) talkshow appearances just don't work. Apart from that, I doubt if Calaway seeks more popularity, he is rather to himself contrary to Hogan. Not to mention that the man is hugely popular already, talkshows won't help that one bit. [[User:84.81.226.215|84.81.226.215]] 20:23, 14 September 2006 (UTC)Marcello

I am not going to respond or acknowledge the post above mine because I don't like that user. Anyway, Darryl, I just gave you a great thing that Undertaker could do if he went on the Late Night Show. I think he might have done that throughout the 90s but didn't think of that idea. Ultimate Warrior did it even though character didn't fit the Arsenio Hall. Thank you for the spelling by the way. [[User:TareTone|TareTone]] 04:27, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

:The thing is, the WWE is '''very''' protective of the characters of Kane and the Undertaker, to the point where Glen Jacobs had to be in character to an extent on the set of See No Evil, and that neither of them has ever been on tribute shows. -[[User:Darryl Hamlin|Darryl Hamlin]] 06:55, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

The Undertaker gimmick is already hugely popular, crowds love seeing Taker in action he doesn't need to enhance his image by appearing on talk shows. The whole fact you don't see Taker at every show really adds to the whole mystic of the gimmick, TareTone haven't you ever heard the expression &quot;less is more&quot;?

The Undertaker that participated at the 1991 Survivor Series looks different from the one after 1994 summerslam with Ted DiBiase's Undertaker vs. Paul Bearer's Undertaker. I have absolutely no proof that they are different people. But can anyone comfirm that it's the same person? [[User:Kingjeff|Kingjeff]] 06:07, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

:I can guarantee you that there has been only one person 'using' the Undertaker gimmick, and that is Mark Calaway. Keep in mind that aging and a new look/outfit and haircut can do a lot to ones appearance. Already the undertaker that lost the casket match against Yokozuna looks different from a 'green' Calaway starting out in the main event WWF.

==Edit summary terminology==
In my [[Help:Edit summary|edit summaries]], '''+''' means &quot;addition of ...&quot; and '''–''' (a [[dash]]) means &quot;removal of ...&quot;. For verbs that may not be found in a standard dictionary, those ending with the past tense suffix '''-ed''' should correlate with a common noun or verb after removal of that suffix. Similarly, a prefix of '''de-''' should mean an opposite, a negation or a removal of whatever verb follows. For still incomprehensible terminology, please notify me on [[User_talk:Mikael_H%C3%A4ggstr%C3%B6m|talk page]].

| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Wikipedia is a free-content encyclopedia [[m:List of Wikipedias|written in 250 languages]] by thousands of users like you and me from all walks of life. As a member of the [[WP:Wc|Welcoming Committee]], I would like to say thanks for being a part of this project.

Here are some links to help you, the new user, on your Wikipedia journey:

*[[Wikipedia:Introduction|Introduction]]
*[[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]]
*[[Help:Editing|Editing a page]]
*[[Wikipedia:Bootcamp|Bootcamp]]
*[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]
*[[Wikipedia:Five pillars|Five pillars]]

Whether you're new to the project or have helped us for a while, remember to use [[Help:Edit summary|edit summaries]] when you're done with a page. Summaries are important because, with those, other editors will understand what you have done with the content. '''REMEMBER''': think twice before clicking &quot;'''Save page'''&quot; below the editing box, since whatever you write in the summary box will permamently go in the [[Help:Page history|history of any page]]. (Spellchecking is important; you cannot change the summary data after you have finished editing.)

Remember, also, to sign your name with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;) or by pressing this button ([[Image:Button sig2.png|Signature button]]) above the box, whenever leaving comments on [[Wikipedia:Talk page|talk pages]].

If you want to know how you're doing on Wikipedia, feel free to check out [[Special:Contributions/Ilikevideogames|your list of contributions]].

If you don't know how to do something, type &lt;nowiki&gt;{{helpme}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on your talk page, and [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]] will come to solve your problems.

After you've stayed here for a while, you might want to take an [[Wikipedia:Editor review|editor review]], or, even better, take a chance at [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship|adminship]].

Wherever the journey takes you, I wish you the best of luck and respect on Wikipedia. If you have any questions about my expertise or this site, you can [[Special:Emailuser/Slgrandson|e-mail me]] or [[User talk:Slgrandson|talk to me]], and I will see about the situation as best as possible.

In the meantime, happy editing!

==Ecological Role==

[[User:Zebadiahjones|Zebadiahjones]] ([[User talk:Zebadiahjones|talk]]) 23:27, 17 February 2008 (UTC) I know this isn't very important, but that whole &quot;ecological role&quot; part sounds ridiculous.  References would be nice.  My old merck vet manual was a lot more helpful than this.
Planning on deleting the ecological role if it stays like it is.
:*That's a legitimate objection. I'm trying to find some sources to substantiate it. Heck, some sources for ANYTHING. This whole article is on a well-documented organism, but inexplicably sourceless. I'd freely encourage you or anyone else to feel free to axe that section if nobody (including me) succeeds at sourcing it. Might be [[WP:Original research|OR]]. - [[User:Vianello|Vianello]] ([[User talk:Vianello|talk]]) 20:37, 3 July 2008 (UTC)
On a related side-note, the word &quot;avoid&quot; was changed to &quot;are kept away from&quot; in this section. I'm not sure it's clear which meaning is intended, though. Do cattle instinctively avoid it, or are they logically kept from it by keepers? The section doesn't really make it clear whether the original sense or the new one is correct. - [[User:Vianello|Vianello]] ([[User talk:Vianello|talk]]) 08:36, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

===Removal===

I've gone ahead and axed this section, which has continued to go unsourced. Here's an archival copy for in case sources are found, so we can re-add it:
----
The lancet flukes are important to [[grassland]]s. To prevent infestation, cattle are kept away from patches of the greenest grass, which has been fertilized by [[manure]]. The danger for them is not the feces itself, but rather the possibility that tiny ants might be at the tops of the blades, carrying the parasite. Therefore, those patches grow undisturbed as cows feed on the remaining grass, which is not enough for all of them. The cows are then forced to eat the green grass, and for a while the cow population rises. Eventually, the parasites infect the cows. Infected cows eat less and fail to reproduce as frequently. The cow population drops, allowing the grass to regrow. The cow population eventually recovers and returns to being wary of the greenest grass, completing the cycle.

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just modified {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Dicrocoelium dendriticum]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=754447049 my edit]. If you have any questions, or need the bot to ignore the links, or the page altogether, please visit [[User:Cyberpower678/FaQs#InternetArchiveBot|this simple FaQ]] for additional information. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/web/20080820210738/http://workforce.cup.edu/Buckelew/dicrocoelium_dendriticum_is_a_bi.htm to http://workforce.cup.edu/Buckelew/dicrocoelium_dendriticum_is_a_bi.htm

When you have finished reviewing my changes, please set the ''checked'' parameter below to '''true''' or '''failed''' to let others know (documentation at {{tlx|Sourcecheck}}).

{{sourcecheck|checked=false}}

*'''Strong Delete''' - An awfully written article. Pure vanity and advertising. Possible notability with the Hall of Fame, but without a legitimate source for that information it's so much hot air. [[User:The Kinslayer|The Kinslayer]] 10:44, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

* NWN: World of Torr accepts donations in violation of the Bioware's EULA and brags about the $2000 its raised since inception on their website.  Bioware has consistently pressed legal action against any server that accepts money to play.  Some sites have tried to skirt this by taking payment as &quot;donations&quot; but this is covered under their &quot;exploit commercially&quot; clause.  They've notably kept off the main Bioware forums possibly to escape censure from the company.  I've quoted the EULA on the discussion page for that article.  This looks like wikitizing for their server and if the end up getting money then this is oh so much spam.~LD &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:12.152.181.251|12.152.181.251]] ([[User talk:12.152.181.251|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/12.152.181.251|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

*'''Delete'''.  The controversial portion, if verified, might warrant a mention in the [[Neverwinter Nights]] article, but otherwise this mod doesn't seem particularly notable. --[[User:Alan Au|Alan Au]] 22:52, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

==Untitled==
Not sure how much creditability there is in the last paragraph.  ETA movements are used in high-end watchs, such as Omega, Breitling, etc...ETA.  In fact, being that Omega is owned by Swatch as well as ETA...stands to reason that they would use ETA movement.

Just an odd commentary. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:65.104.118.90|65.104.118.90]] ([[User talk:65.104.118.90|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/65.104.118.90|contribs]]) 22:06, 30 October 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

REPLY:

Actually many non Swatch brands use ETA 2892.A2 movements (and 775X movements) in their high end watches. Bretiling is one, but if you look at the following link, you will find many.

==Elegance, Technology and Accuracy==
ETA does not stand for &quot;Elegance, Technology and Accuracy&quot; or anything else, I have therefore removed the reference.[[Special:Contributions/202.131.190.96|202.131.190.96]] ([[User talk:202.131.190.96|talk]]) 00:13, 13 December 2007 (UTC)

You may be correct but if you go here: http://www.eta.ch/ and allow the &quot;flash&quot; to play you may be surprized. [[User:Luger229|Luger229]] ([[User talk:Luger229|talk]]) 23:38, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

==Fair use rationale for Image:ETA.SA Logo.JPG==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:ETA.SA Logo.JPG]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:ETA.SA Logo.JPG|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;

==Moved for discussion: Brands using ETA movements==
This list, with a single, poor source, is a magnet for promotion.  Without proper sourcing by [[WP:IS|independent]], [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], I've moved it here.  The one reference appears to be from a promotional piece for IWC. --[[User:Ronz|Ronz]] ([[User talk:Ronz|talk]]) 17:56, 9 January 2009 (UTC)
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mechanical ETA movements are commonly used in many &quot;mid-range&quot; brands such as [[Bulova]], [[Hamilton Watch Company|Hamilton]], [[Markus Ruby]], [[Mido (watch)|Mido]], [[Oris (Watches)|Oris]], [[Fortis Uhren AG|Fortis]], [[Tissot]] and [[Certina]], and also in many &quot;high-end&quot; watch brands such as [[Breitling]], [[International Watch Company|IWC]], [[Longines]], [[Officine Panerai]], [[TAG Heuer]], [[Omega SA|Omega]], [[Porsche Design]], [[Rado (watch)|Rado]] among others. ETA's Quartz Movement lines are used in both &quot;high-end&quot; quartz brands as well as more affordable brands, such as Calvin Klein, flik-flak, Swatch and Swiss Army among others. At the very least, the ETA movements usually carry the watch brands' name on the automatic rotor or otherwise on the top plate if the watch is a manual-wind movement. The more prestigious brands such as Omega and IWC undertake significant modifications of the basic ETA movement. The numerous modifications and the great care taken completely transform the original, mass-produced movement by ETA into something new. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmwf.com/Watches/Series/IWCGSTChronoBeachHuaHin/UhrenjournalIWCUseOfBaseMovements.html Uhrenjournal (Austria) on IWC's Use of ETA Base Movements&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Radamel Falcao García Zárate''' ({{IPA-es|raðaˈmel falˈkao}}; 10 February 1986), also known as '''Radamel Falcao''', or simply '''Falcao''', is a Colombian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for [[Ligue 1]] club [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]], for whom he also serves as captain, and the [[Colombia national football team|Colombia national team]]. He is sometimes nicknamed &quot;''El Tigre''&quot; (Spanish for ''The Tiger'') or &quot;King of the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Graham |last=MacAree |title=On Radamel Falcao, King of the Europa League |url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2012/5/11/3014138/radamel-falcao-europa-league |publisher=Sbnation.com |date=5 November 2012 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talksport.co.uk/magazine/features/120510/where-next-europa-league-king-radamel-falcao-171739 |title=Magazine: Where next for Europa League king Radamel Falcao? |publisher=talkSPORT|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falcao began his career at [[Lanceros Boyacá]], before moving to Argentinian club [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] where he won the [[2007–08 Argentine Primera División|2007–08]] [[Apertura and Clausura in Argentine football|Clausura]] tournament. In 2009, he joined Portuguese club [[FC Porto|Porto]] where he won several trophies, including the [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] and [[2010–11 Primeira Liga|Primeira Liga]] double in [[2010–11 FC Porto season|2011]]. Falcao became their all-time [[List of FC Porto records and statistics#Goalscorers|top goalscorer in international club competitions]] and set the record for [[UEFA Cup and Europa League records and statistics#Most goals in a single season|most goals]] (17) in a European campaign. He also became the first Colombian to receive the [[Portuguese Golden Ball]] award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atleticofans.com/11854/falcao-awarded-the-portuguese-golden-ball/&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Falcao transferred to [[Atlético Madrid]] for a club record €40&amp;nbsp;million, leading them to [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] and [[2012 UEFA Super Cup|Super Cup]] victories in 2012. Falcao finished as top goalscorer for the second straight year and became the first player to win consecutive Europa League titles with two different teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1628393.html?intcmp=newsreader_news_box_2 Falcao shines again as Atletico rule Europa]. FIFA.com. Retrieved 10 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Falcao joined newly promoted Monaco for a club record €60&amp;nbsp;million; however, an [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|ACL injury]] ruled him out for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leonmeadmd.com/an_acl_injury_the_falcao_case/ |title=Leon Mead MD |date= |accessdate=1 September 2014 |website= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Falcao spent the next two seasons on loan at [[Premier League]] clubs [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], eventually rejoining Monaco in 2016 and leading them to [[Ligue 1]] title for the 2016–17 season.

Falcao made his senior debut for Colombia in 2007 and has since earned over 70 caps and scored 29 goals, making him their [[Colombia national football team#Top scorers|all-time top scorer]]. He represented the country at the [[2011 Copa América|2011]] and [[2015 Copa América]], but missed the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] through injury.

==Club career==
===Lanceros Boyacá===
Falcao made his debut for [[Lanceros Boyacá]] in the Colombian [[Categoría Primera B]] (second tier) on 28 August 1999 at the age of 13 years and 199 days, thus becoming the youngest debutant at that level of Colombian professional football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-7295310 |title=En Colombia se vive la 'Falcaomanía' |language=Spanish |trans-title='Falcaomania' is rife in Colombia |first1=Jimmy |last1=Montes |first2=José Orlando |last2=Ascencio |last-author-amp=yes |work=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |location=Colombia |date=20 February 2010 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Lanceros' coach, Hernán Pacheco, began to consider the 14-year-old more seriously; Falcao played seven matches that year.&lt;ref name=LancerosFalcao&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dimayor.com/noticias/radamel_falca_garcia_jugo_en_la_segunda_division_en_colombia_540.html |title=Radamel Falcao García jugó en la Segunda División en Colombia |language=Spanish |trans-title=Radamel Falcao García played in the Colombian Second Division |first=William J. |last=Marín S. |publisher=División Mayor del Fútbol Profesional Colombiano |date=12 April 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120064037/http://dimayor.com/noticias/radamel_falca_garcia_jugo_en_la_segunda_division_en_colombia_540.html |archivedate=20 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July, at the Estadio Olímpico del Sol at [[Sogamoso]], he scored his first and only goal for the club, to seal a 2–0 win against Club El Cóndor that took Lanceros off the bottom of the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1247214 |title=Lanceros frenó al Cóndor |language=Spanish |trans-title=Lanceros put the brakes on Cóndor |work=El Tiempo |date=25 April 2000 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his two years with the club, he played eight matches and scored once.&lt;ref name=LancerosFalcao/&gt;

===River Plate===
After training with [[Millonarios F.C.|Millonarios]], who did not take up their option to purchase the player,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/deportes/noticias/falcao-garcia-podra-vestir-camiseta-millonarios |title=Falcao García no podrá vestir camiseta de Millonarios |language=Spanish |trans-title=Falcao García couldn't wear the Millonarios shirt |work=[[El País (Cali)|El País]] |location=Cali |date=15 May 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falcao was sold to [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] of Argentina in February 2001 for a $500,000 fee.&lt;ref name=LancerosFalcao/&gt;&lt;ref name=RiverFalcao&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/EdicionImpresa/deportiva/nota.asp?nota_id=949050 |title=San Falcao, la experiencia religiosa a la que se aferra River |language=Spanish |trans-title=Saint Falcao, the religious experience that River clings to |first=Juan Pablo |last=Varsky |work=[[La Nación]] |location=Buenos Aires |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his River career in the youth team, playing in the eighth division of Argentine football.&lt;ref name=RiverFalcao/&gt; River coach [[Leonardo Astrada]] gave Falcao his professional debut in the [[2004–05 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Clausura|2005 Torneo Clausura]], on 6 March 2005, in a game that the club won 3–1 to [[Instituto Atlético Central Córdoba|Instituto de Córdoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/futbol/reporte?juegoId=178475 | title=River ganó con autoridad y sigue arriba | publisher=ESPN | date=6 March 2005 | accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1589245-historias-y-anecdotas-de-cuando-falcao-llego-a-river-con-15-anos | title=Historias y anécdotas de cuando Falcao llegó a River con 15 años | publisher=La Nación | date=7 June 2013 | accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falcao became a regular in the first team during the [[2005–06 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Apertura|2005 Torneo Apertura]]. He scored twice in a match for the first time in Argentina, on 2 October in a game against [[Independiente de Avellaneda|Independiente]] that finished as a 3–1 win for River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=214029&amp;IdxSeccion=100795 |title=Falcao hizo festejar a River |language=Spanish |trans-title=Falcao had a ball at River |work=Infobae |date=3 October 2005 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated the feat twice more during the Apertura: against [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]], his brace contributed to a 4–1 home win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.diariodecuyo.com.ar/home/new_noticia.php?noticia_id=126467 |title=El colombiano Falcao Garcia se consolida como goleador de River |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Colombian Falcao García establishes himself as River's goalscorer |work=Diario de Cuyo |location=San Juan, Argentina |date=9 November 2005 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and against [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]], River won 5–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.terra.com/deportes/articulo/html/fox209973.htm |title=Falcao García marca dos tantos en goleada de River a San Lorenzo |language=Spanish |trans-title=Falcao García scores two in River's goalfest at San Lorenzo |agency=EFE |work=[[Terra Networks|Terra]] |date=17 November 2005 |accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought his total for the competition to seven from as many games&lt;ref name=ESPNstats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/87706/radamel-falcao?cc=5739#ui-tabs-2 |title=Radamel Falcao: Appearances |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=26 December 2012}} Select season required via dropdown menu.&lt;/ref&gt; under the management of [[Reinaldo Merlo]], who gave Falcao the trust he needed to establish himself in the team.

In the match against [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] in November, Falcao injured the ligaments of his right knee and missed the remainder of the Apertura; then, during pre-season training in January 2006, he sustained more serious damage to the same knee, which required surgery and was expected to keep him out for at least six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/deportes/futbol/liga-argentina/river-plate-perdio-a-falcao-garcia-para-el-resto-del-apertura-2005/2005-11-23/120610.html |title=River Plate perdió a Falcao García para el resto del Apertura 2005 |language=Spanish |trans-title=River Plate lost Falcao García for the rest of the 2005 Apertura |publisher=[[Radio Cooperativa]] |date=23 November 2005 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.terra.com/deportes/articulo/html/fox220456.htm |title=Grave lesión de colombiano Falcao |language=Spanish |trans-title=Serious injury to the Colombian Falcao |work=Terra |date=20 January 2006 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the field in September, soon after the start of the [[2006–07 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Apertura|2006 Torneo Apertura]], in which he made 12 appearances, mainly as a [[substitute (association football)|substitute]]; he scored just once, to seal a 2–0 win against [[Rosario Central]] that took River clear at the top of the table.&lt;ref name=ESPNstats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=282428&amp;IdxSeccion=100803 |title=River construyó una victoria que lo llevó a la punta |language=Spanish |trans-title=River constructed a victory that took them to the top |work=Infobae |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days earlier, he made his debut in [[CONMEBOL]] competition, in the last eight of the [[2006 Copa Sudamericana]] against [[Atlético Paranaense]] of Brazil. He was replaced at half-time, and the match finished 2–2, so River were eliminated on aggregate, having lost the home leg 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/deportes/20061013/eliminan-a-river_22989_22989.html |title=Eliminan a River |language=Spanish |trans-title=River go out |work=Los Tiempos |location=Bolivia |date=12 October 2006 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was sent off in his only outing in the [[2007 Copa Libertadores]], against [[Colo-Colo]] in February 2007.&lt;ref name=ESPNstats/&gt; Domestically, he made little impression on the [[2006–07 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Clausura|2007 Torneo Clausura]]. He scored in only one of the eight games he played: River's first two goals as they beat [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] 4–2 away from home.&lt;ref name=ESPNstats/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2007/02/25/0001/15/D53357A5AC704AC69961E6235F9A05C8.html |title=River ganó 4–2 y lidera con Arsenal el torneo argentino |language=Spanish |trans-title=River won 4–2 and lead the Argentina league alongside Arsenal |work=[[El Universo]] |location=Ecuador |date=25 February 2007 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falcao scored his first professional [[hat-trick]] on 28 September 2007, as River made a historic comeback against [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] to progress in the 2007 Sudamericana.&lt;ref name=ESPNstats/&gt; The following week, he scored his first goal in a ''[[Superclásico]]'', the first of River's goals as they beat [[Boca Juniors]] 2–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/07/10/07/ultmo_306950.asp |title=River gana el clásico y Pasarella respira |language=Spanish |trans-title=Rover win the derby and Passarella breathes |work=El País |location=Uruguay |date=7 October 2007 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

River Plate were reported to have rejected a $15&amp;nbsp;million offer from [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] for Falcao in early 2008, as well as bids from clubs including [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]]. He was a key player as [[Diego Simeone]] led River to the [[2007–08 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Clausura|2008 Torneo Clausura]] championship, his first domestic title, and his performances meant he was linked with moves to a variety of clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/8/main/2008/07/02/759413/madrid-man-united-chase-falcao |title=Madrid, Man United Chase Falcao |first=Gregory |last=Sica |publisher=Goal.com |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he remained with River as they suffered the worst campaign in their history, finishing bottom of the [[2008–09 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Apertura|2008 Torneo Apertura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ole.clarin.com/notas/2008/12/14/futbollocal/01822237.html |title=¡Guau!

In 2009, River Plate had a difficult start: they were eliminated in the group stage of the [[Copa Libertadores 2009]] and won few games at the beginning of the [[2008–09 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Clausura|2009 Torneo Clausura]]. Falcao retained his eye for goal and was instrumental in [[Nestor Gorosito]]'s plans, having matured as a striker over the previous two years; he finished as top scorer with 43 goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN profile&quot;/&gt;

On 7 June 2017, Falcao became the Colombian national team's all-time top-goalscorer, scoring his 26th goal in a 2–2 draw with [[Spain national football team|Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/falcao-becomes-colombias-all-time-top-goalscorer|title=Falcao becomes Colombia's all-time top goalscorer|date=7 June 2017|work=FourFourTwo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to score twice in the team's four remaining World Cup qualifying matches, as Colombia confirmed their qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] on 10 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2017/m=10/news=una-noche-magica-para-uruguay-argentina-y-colombia-2913140-2913296.html|title=Night to remember for Uruguay, Argentina and Colombia|date=11 October 2017|work=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Falcao has been described as a &quot;natural goal scorer&quot; and a striker with the &quot;ability to bag a goal from nothing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topoulakitsiou.eu/2012/05/radamel-falcao-garcia-zarate.html |title=Radamel Falcao García Zárate &amp;#124; topoulakitsiou |publisher=Topoulakitsiou.eu |date=10 February 1986 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totalfootballmag.com/features/world-football/the-worlds-current-top-5-strikers |publisher=totalfootballmag.com |title=The world’s top 5 strikers |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fifa.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/ballondor/news/newsid=1804906/ |title=Falcao: Several players deserve the Ballon d’Or |publisher=FIFA |date=30 October 2012 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His abilities to adapt to most positions and scoring goals with various parts of his body has resulted in goals. Described as a &quot;poacher&quot;, Falcao is often labeled as a &quot;pure striker&quot;, often playing as a traditional &quot;number 9&quot; and capitalizing on less amount of chances that are given to him than the typical goal scorer. His footing and curves are highly noticeable through his games regardless of distance and/or positions. Falcao is well known for having a strong weak foot (left) that is on equals with his right foot (preference), allowing him to be flexible with goal scoring. Falcao controls a well-balanced pace, helping him keep his stamina in check and allowing him to often outrun other players in the most critical battling-for-the-ball moments. The strength of his shots is often well controlled, in terms of distance and angles, as shown throughout his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;fifa.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccernews.com/simeone-falcao-is-the-best/105724/ |title=Simeone: Falcao is the best |publisher=Soccer News |date=27 October 2012 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dotinga |first=Renger |url=http://sg.sports.yahoo.com/news/falcao-urges-focus-world-cup-qualifiers-095400926--spt.html |title=Falcao urges focus in World Cup qualifiers – Yahoo!

==Personal life==
[[File:Radamel Falcao García Signature.svg|thumb|Falcao's signature]]
Falcao is a second generation footballer, with his father Radamel García having played professionally as a defender in Colombia and Venezuela, moving to the latter country when Falcao was five. At first, he was picked on in Venezuela for not being good at the country's most popular sport, [[baseball]].&lt;ref name=worswick/&gt;

His name derives from the 1980s [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]], [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] and [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] legend [[Paulo Roberto Falcão]], as a tribute from his father Radamel García. Despite being named Radamel, he prefers to use his middle name in interviews. Falcao is married to Argentinean singer Lorelei Taron. In early 2013, it was revealed that Falcao was expecting his first child with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hashim |first=Ash |url=http://sg.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/futbolita/atletico-madrid-falcao-liverpool-pepe-reina-embrace-fatherhood-044619487.html |title=Atletico Madrid’s Falcao and Liverpool’s Pepe Reina embrace fatherhood |publisher=Yahoo!

He is partially of [[English people|English]] descent; George King, one of his great-grandfathers, emigrated from the [[North Yorkshire]] village of [[Burn, North Yorkshire|Burn]] near [[Selby]] in 1932 to work as an accountant for the [[United Fruit Company]] in Colombia. Owing to this ancestry, Falcao's father attempted to make it easier for his son to play in Europe by obtaining a [[British passport]] for him, however this was rejected.&lt;ref name=worswick&gt;{{cite news|last1=Worswick|first1=Carl|title=Radamel Falcao has Yorkshire roots... his great-grandfather was an accountant from Selby, says Manchester United star's dad as he reveals striker's tough childhood|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2794356/radamel-falcao-s-blood-makes-proud-yorkshire-roots-man-united-dream-come-true-says-dad.html|accessdate=1 November 2014|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

============Re: My dis approvals==========

Hello, [[User:Psneog|Sir]],

I just wanted to clear some points here, Dr. Hazarika basically born in Sadiya, Assam, British Inida. Since, currently Assam is a part of Republic of India technically Dr. Hazarika is an Indian rather than an Assamese. Assamese  is a culture/language rather than a nationality. That I wanna make clear. Someone is editing it very often I'm unable to get who as many are actually not loged in. This actually creating a confusion on the word '''Assamese''' and also Dr. Hazarika's nationality for foreigners, it's okay for the Assamese people but many fan of him from other parts of India will also object.

Secondly, respected Kalpana Lajmi is not his wife in any sense. She also told NewLive that it's yellow journalism. She was his manager, friend and directed movies where his gave voice of music direction etc. I don't know from where this is also coming but we need to stop this.

Finally, the formatting and punctuation is poor on many edits. It's hard to find who's doing what in a Wiki but we active users must take it on our hands as a responsibility to improve this article.

Regards,

[[User:Wrix24x7|Wrix]]  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 18:08, 11 November 2011 (UTC).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


: * Regarding Kalpana Lajmi, you are right. I misinterpreted the &quot;spouse&quot; word and confused it with the &quot;partner&quot; parameter. (Lajmi was his live in partner, they have openly stated it in many press appearances. There is multiple stories from independent sources. Probably you have overlooked the ref.s 12, 13, 14, from different sources:

: * ^ http://ibnlive.in.com/blogs/rituparnachatterjee/2802/62880/kalpana-lajmibhupen-hazarika-a-40yearold-love-story.html
: * ^ http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/northeast/hazarika-funeral-put-fans-keep-pouring-063
: * ^ http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?Section=Movies&amp;ID=ENTEN20110187485&amp;subcatg=MOVIESINDIA&amp;keyword=music&amp;nid=147290

Sri Neog,Reference from news channels and are never credible so are the blogs.I dont think they are of much importance.Moreover I dont  think the name &quot;Kalpana Lazmi&quot; be mentioned under the vital statistics of Dr. Bhupen Hazarika without approval from his wife or son. This page was created only after the demise of the legend. You could have done that when he was still alive and talking.

: It should have been spouse: Priyambada (1950-1963) and partner: Kalpana.So maybe we should have corrected it accordingly, instead of removing it altogether?

: Regarding Priyambada Patel, his ex wife, what was the problem? Was it necessary to remove? If there were no ref.s, we could've done it with a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{citation needed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;?

: Are you sure that India at that time called &quot;Indian Empire?&quot; I've came across &quot;British India&quot; but never heard &quot;Indian Emoire&quot;, so please clear my doubt.

: Images: Was it necessary to remove them? If so why? What about the signature image? Please check.

:'''Here is what I'd like you to consider:
# Revert the page to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bhupen_Hazarika&amp;oldid=460164299 this revision]
# Then make the following changes:
## Spouse = {{marriage|Priyambada Patel|1950|1963}} and partner = [[Kalpana Lajmi]]. I'll provide references. 
## Change &quot;Indian Empire&quot; to &quot;British India&quot;, or &quot;Pre Independence India.
# Then we stop modifying the article page, discuss on this page and put information on the article page only after we all agree.
# '''Until we all agree on  the above, we should refrain from editing from now on, and keep it as it is right now.'''

: * I'd like to clear up myself and the topic itself. Dr. Hazarika's wife respected Priyambada Patel, never got divorced moreover, she's staying in Canada and that's their family matter but in a interview to Newlive aired on 11th Nov, Kalpana Lajmi said &quot;Priyam Bo came to see him&quot;, she also said that she's 84 and her health is also not good from last 5 years thus, she stopped coming. Thus, Dr. Hazarika's relationship with his wife can be said &quot;separated&quot; in my point-of-view rather than, &quot;Ex-wife&quot; or something. Kalpana Lajmi also said that, Dr. Hazarika was so much involved into his music that he wasn't able to give time to his wife and son, so both the parties lived parallel lives but emotional bond between them was there. So, regarding his '''spouse''' field I'd suggest '''separated''' or nothing. Kalpana Lajimi deserves to be called '''partner''' or '''manager'''.

Pre-Independent India, was called '''British India'''  or '''British Raj''' (in Indian form of English, mixed language). So, I'd also suggest this to be changed.

'''Wrix'''

:Thanks for your input, '''Wrix'''.

:So let me go ahead. For now lets go ahead, I'll try to present the spouce/separated part carefully. There is a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{married}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template, we can use that. I'll also put a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{citation needed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag. In the mean time, lets try to get some reliable reference material. In fact being in Guwahati, it'd be much easier for you. So, let's not fight, lets write. However, right now we need to gather information and present it ASAP (of course, we need to be correct, so we'll follow Wikipedia policy documents (please see your talk page for these documents.)

==Unconstructive edits==
#I removed the infobox from this talk page - this is not the place for test edits.
#Wikipedia is [[WP:NOTMEMORIAL|not a memorial site]], but the edits since his death are largely POV; examples: &quot;the trio who had a tremendous impact on his professional life&quot; is unencyclopedic per [[WP:WTA]], &quot;whose lessons on humanity and universalism were to last Bhupen Hazarika's entire life&quot; is original research and editorializing, &quot;the doyens of Assamese culture&quot; is merely promotional, and so on

: If they trio did have a tremendous impact on his professional life, how else would you word it?  Bhupen Hazarika has frequently talked about the influence.  What is probably lacking is a reference, which will ultimately come by.  
: &quot;doyens&quot; is word found in most reputed dictionary and used widely in India.  So is Indian English colloquial for an Indian? 
: [[User:Chaipau|Chaipau]] ([[User talk:Chaipau|talk]]) 21:18, 12 November 2011 (UTC)

#&quot;Dr.&quot; is not part of a person's name but a title.
#[[:File:Bhupen Hazarika.jpg]] is missing evidence of permission.
#Section headings are not for one or two sentences.
#&quot;Personal biography&quot; does not make any sense as a section title.

: So what would you recommend?  This section deals with Bhupen Hazarika's personal issues, separating it from his artistic life.

#The article is now full of short and shoppy paragraphs - if you want to make a complete rewrite, use a sandbox.
[[User:Hekerui|Hekerui]] ([[User talk:Hekerui|talk]]) 12:21, 12 November 2011 (UTC)

: there is no other way to improve a collaborative article.

== Overenthusiastic tags==
I have removed over-enthusiastic tags by[[User:Hekerui|Hekerui]] .  These tags should be properly and specifically justified.  I had addressed the earlier concerns and made edit changes accordingly.  The newer tags are not justified.  

The only justification new edits are in the form of an edit summary, which reads: '&quot;infused with humanity and universalism&quot; - POV not taken care of', and the original tags were reinstated.  The particular phrase is a new one (so does not warrant a &quot;not taken care of&quot;), and it is general and broad characterization of the artist's theme of his entire opus (over a seventy-year period) that is made in the introductory part of the article.  What it probably lacks is a citation and a general tag is unwarranted.  Also, this article is a work in progress under [[Project:Assam]].  Constructive comments and specific guides are welcome, though broad tagging does not help.  

[[User:Chaipau|Chaipau]] ([[User talk:Chaipau|talk]]) 11:52, 14 November 2011 (UTC)
:You must be joking. The lead is written like an laudatory obituary. &quot;Known for writing strong lyrics with themes of communal amity, universal justice and empathy, his songs have become popular among all sections of ethnic and religious communities in Assam.&quot; - this is pure POV - the characterization is made by you. The overenthusiatic editing is your work and the maintenance templates should stay so the article may be fixed in the future. Also, why &quot;broad tagging&quot;? Maintenance templates only help if they are visible. [[User:Hekerui|Hekerui]] ([[User talk:Hekerui|talk]]) 09:19, 15 November 2011 (UTC)

:: &quot;...written like a laudatory obituary&quot;, is your personal point of view.  As i mentioned, what is missing here is a citation.  This is a summary of what will be justified in the &quot;Legacy&quot; section, duly referenced.  But I don't want to get into an edit war with you and will let the tags stand for now, as I concentrate on adding more heft to the article.  I repeat my earlier request---make specific observations about what you think are POV or problematic parts of the article at specific points and help the growth of this article.

{{Campaignbox Soviet war in Afghanistan}}

The '''Panjshir offensives''' ({{lang-ru|Панджшерские операции}} – Panjsher Operations) were a series of battles between the [[Soviet Army]] and groups of [[Afghan Mujahideen]] under [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] for the control of the strategic [[Panjshir Valley]], during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] in the period from 1980 to 1985.

These battles saw some of the most violent fighting of the whole war, during the nine campaigns launched, coordinated Soviet assaults would regularly drive out the Mujahideen from the valley but they would return as soon as the Soviets left.

==A Strategic Objective==

The Panjshir Valley lies 70&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Kabul]], in the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains close to the [[Kotal-e Salang|Salang Pass]], which connects Kabul to the northern areas of Afghanistan and further on to [[Uzbekistan]], then part of the [[Soviet Union]]. In June 1979, an insurrection led by Ahmed Shah Massoud expelled all government forces, and the valley became a guerrilla stronghold.
From the Panjshir, Mujahideen groups frequently carried out ambushes against Soviet convoys bringing supplies to the [[40th Army (Soviet Union)|40th Army]] stationed in Afghanistan. The Salang Pass became a dangerous area, and Soviet truck drivers were even awarded decorations for having successfully crossed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;FMSO&quot;&gt;

|accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure on the logistic system determined the Soviet command to try and dislodge the rebels.

==Soviet Strategy==
Soviet offensives into the Panjshir Valley had three main tactical features. There was (1) the concentration of air assets, including extensive aerial bombardment of a target area followed by (2) the landing of helicopter forces to stop the withdrawal of enemy forces and engage the enemy from unexpected directions and (3) a drive by of mechanized forces into areas of guerrilla support in conjunction with the helicopter landing parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Amstutz, J. Bruce | title = Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation | year= 1986 | publisher = National Defense University Press | page= 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was these kinds of tactics that caused so much destruction in the civilian populations in these regions.  By forcing the mass migration of civilians from the Panjshir Valley and destroying all crops and livestock, the Soviets hoped to deprive [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] of resources to sustain his full-time fighters.

==Shortcomings of Soviet Strategy==
This tactic had some success as Massoud was forced to sign a cease fire treaty in January 1983 that would last for one year in order to rebuild his organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Urban, Mark | title = War In Afghanistan | year= 1990 | publisher = St. Martin's Press | page= 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom line though was that these victories were very temporary.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} There were serious issues with this tactic of large punitive offensives that contributed to the [[stalemate]] that characterized the war. Mujahideen forces would often learn of coming offensives in advance from their compatriots in the DRA army. Not only could civilians and guerrillas move safely out of the way of the majority of the bombs but guerrillas could also plan ambushes, lay mines, and move weapons caches. Once armored personnel carriers and helicopters came the guerrillas would retreat into the side valleys and carry out small ambushes rather than openly confront the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robbins|first1=Neal|title=Soviets leveling Afghanistan's Panjshir valley|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/05/01/Soviets-leveling-Afghanistans-Panjshir-valley/2258452232000/|website=UPI|publisher=UPI|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

===Panjshir I - September, 1980&lt;ref&gt;Urban, M (1988) War in Afghanistan. p.70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grau, L. W. (2002) The Soviet-Afghan War - How a superpower fought and lost. p.31&lt;/ref&gt;===

===Panjshir II - October, 1980===

===Panjshir III - March 3–4, 1981===

The first three offensives were small-scale operations, involving only four [[battalion]]s. The Mujahideen, who weren't strong enough to confront the Soviet army in the open, blended in with the local population and generally waited until the Soviets had left to resume their activities.

===Panjshir IV - September 6, 1981===

By this time, Massoud had mustered enough men to openly resist the Soviet assault. During this offensive, to avoid losing vehicles to [[land mine]]s, the Soviets sent their [[sapper]] units to clear the way in front of the main force. This tactic proved costly, and the attack force penetrated only 25&amp;nbsp;km into the valley before retiring, after having suffered 100 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Will &amp; Shariat, Abdullah(2004); ''Fighting Masoud's war''; Lothian books {{ISBN|0-7344-0590-1}}, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panjshir V - May 16, 1982===

The first major offensive was carried out by a force of 12,000 soldiers under the command of General N.G. Ter-Grigoryan supported by 104 helicopters and 26 airplanes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artofwar1&quot;&gt;
{{cite web|last=Lyakhovskiy |first=Aleksandr |url=http://artofwar.ru/l/ljahowskij_a_a/text_0010.shtml |title=''Ахмад Шах''('''Russian''')|publisher=  ''http://artofwar.ru/''|accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main assault began on the night of May 16, after an intense aviation and artillery bombardment.
While motorized rifle battalions, preceded by [[reconnaissance]] units, attacked the dominating features at the entrance of the valley, airborne units were airlifted by helicopter behind the main Mujahideen defenses. In all, 4,200 troops were airlifted into the valley to capture strategic points, right up to the [[Pakistan]]i border, in an effort to cut the Mujahideen supply lines.
In some areas the fighting was intense: when a [[Russian Airborne Troops|Soviet paratrooper]] regiment landed east of Rukha, it was quickly encircled and suffered significant losses. The beleaguered paratroopers were saved only by the arrival of a motorised rifle battalion led by Major Aushev, who forced his way through the Mujahideen defenses, consisting of well-located strong points, and captured Rukha. For his actions, Aushev was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Artofwar1&quot; /&gt;

Massoud, who expected an attack similar to the previous ones, had disposed his defenses close to the entrance of the valley, and was thus unable to prevent the Soviets from gaining footholds in the Panjshir. They established three main bases at Rukha, [[Bazarak, Panjshir|Bazarak]] and Anava. Most of the Mujahideen had survived the attack and Massoud divided them into small, mobile groups that fought the Soviets all down the valley.

During this offensive, the Soviets managed to occupy a large part of the Panjshir and scored some successes against Massoud's organization, such as the capture of a list of the names of 600 of his agents in Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivier Roy (professor)|Roy, Olivier]](1990); ''Islam and resistance in Afghanistan''; Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-39700-6}}, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the rebels had escaped capture, and this was not the decisive victory the Soviets had been hoping for. Also, their heavily fortified bases only gave them control over the valley floor, while the surrounding heights were still held by the Mujahideen. For this reason they decided to launch a sixth offensive.

===Panjshir VI - August - September, 1982===

The sixth offensive consisted of a series of sweeps conducted by motorized units and by airborne [[Spetsnaz]] units, launched from their bases in the Panjshir, to find and destroy the Mujahideen hideouts. It was accompanied by a heavy aerial bombardment of villages suspected of harbouring rebel groups, notably carried out by [[Tupolev Tu-16|Tu-16]] bombers flying from inside the Soviet Union. Airborne Troops carried out [[search and destroy]] missions, encircling Massoud's mobile units and destroying some of them. However, as a rule attrition among the Mujahideen was low,&lt;ref&gt;Roy,  p.175&lt;/ref&gt; and the brunt of the attacks fell on the civilian population, who suffered heavily, many of them preferring to flee the valley.

Despite bitter fighting, the Soviets were unable to eradicate the Mujahideen, and the battle soon developed into a stalemate. During the 5th and 6th offensives the Soviets suffered up to 3,000 casualties, and 1,000 [[Military of Afghanistan|Afghan Army]] soldiers defected to the Mujahideen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baumann |first=Robert |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2001/soviet-afghan_compound-warfare.htm |title=''Compound War Case Study: The Soviets in Afghanistan''|publisher=  ''http://www.globalsecurity.org/''|accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the height of the offensive had passed, many areas captured by the Soviet forces were handed over to Afghan army units, who suffered from low morale and high desertion rates. They were the targets for Massoud's counterattacks. In a series of surprise attacks, several government outposts fell to the rebels. The first was the Afghan Army outpost at Saricha, which the Mujahideen captured along with 80 prisoners and 8 tanks, despite having to cross a minefield.&lt;ref&gt;Davies &amp; Shariat p.186&lt;/ref&gt; The government post at Birjaman fell soon after, and the Mujahideen were able to recapture some areas in this way. These operations, along with the continued harassment of Soviet garrisons and resupply convoys, proved that the Mujahideen were far from defeated, and convinced the Soviets that they must negotiate a truce with Massoud.

In January 1983, for the first time a ceasefire was concluded between the Soviets and the Mujahideen, lasting 6 months, and later extended. Negotiated by Massoud in person with a colonel of the [[GRU]], Anatoly Tkachev,&lt;ref name=&quot;Artofwar1&quot;/&gt; the agreement stipulated that Soviet troops should evacuate the Panjshir, except for a small garrison at Anava, whose access was controlled by the Mujahideen. The area covered by the ceasefire included the Panjshir valley, but not the Salang pass, where fighting continued.&lt;ref&gt;Davies &amp; Shariat p.197&lt;/ref&gt;

Massoud took advantage of the truce to extend his influence over areas that had until then been held by hostile factions loyal to [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s Hezb-i-islami party, like in [[Andarab District]]. More peacefully, he took control of the [[Khost wa Fereng District|Khost-Fereng sector]], and some areas in southern [[Takhar Province]], while establishing contacts with other guerrilla groups in [[Baghlan Province]], and persuading them to adopt his military organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; He also ordered the strengthening of defenses in five subsidiary valleys as well as in the Panjshir, permitting a defense in depth, and withdrew his headquarters to Shira Mandara, in Takhar province, in anticipation of a renewed assault.

===Panjshir VII - April 19 to September 1984===

In February 1984, [[Konstantin Chernenko]] replaced [[Yuri Andropov]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. While Andropov had supported the ceasefire, Chernenko, a disciple of [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]], believed that the guerrillas should be rooted out through military action, an opinion which he shared with [[Babrak Karmal]], president of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|DRA]]. As a result a new offensive was planned, which, in Karmal's words, should be decisive and merciless, and in order to destroy the Panjshir valley bases, all those living there should be killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artofwar1&quot;/&gt; It was the largest offensive in the region to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Tanner, Stephen. &quot;Afghanistan: A Military History&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some Soviets, who were supporters of Andropov, disagreed with this policy, and they gave Massoud advance warning of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Davies &amp; Shariat p.213&lt;/ref&gt; Through this channel, and thanks to his agents in the DRA government Massoud had a precise idea of the Soviet plans, and he was able to counter them. To avoid civilian casualties, all 30,000 inhabitants of the Panjshir (from a population of 100,000 before the war) were evacuated to safe areas.&lt;ref&gt;Roy p.201&lt;/ref&gt; Only ambush parties were left to delay the Soviet advance. All the roads, villages and helicopter landing zones were heavily mined. All these preparations were carried out in secret, and a token activity was maintained near the Soviet base at Anava, to deceive the Soviets into believing that a conventional defense was being prepared.

11,000 Soviet and 2,600 Afghan soldiers, under [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] [[Sergei Sokolov (Marshal)|Sergei Sokolov]] participated in the offensive, supported by 200 airplanes and 190 helicopters. On April 22, after a two-day bombardment of the region by Tu-16, [[Tu-22M]] and [[Sukhoi Su-24|Su-24]] bombers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Markovsky |first= Victor |url=http://combatavia.info/index9afg2.html |title=''Афганистан : применение дальней авиации''('''In Russian''')|publisher=  ''http://combatavia.info/''|accessdate=2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; they advanced rapidly into the Panjshir. Several battalion strength forces were placed at key passes leading out of the Panjshir Valley while at the same time large helicopter troop landings were made in tributary valleys connected to the Panjshir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Urban, Mark | title = War In Afghanistan | year= 1990 | publisher = St. Martin's Press | page= 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; By blocking the Mujahideen's withdrawal routes and securing the high ground, the Soviets forced them higher into the mountains then they had previously ventured and scattered their strength as they attempted to avoid being trapped by the helicopter landings. Once the strength of Massoud's forces were dealt such a deadly blow, rather than withdrawing from the valley as they had previously done they began setting up a system of forts and posts throughout the main valley while relinquishing control of the side valleys. These tactics proved more effective at rooting out insurgents and breaking up their fighting forces during the offensive but had limited long term success. The forts and outposts along the Panjshir Valley were unable to protect roads and convoys as well as they had hoped and these installations proved attractive targets for the Mujahideen to harass. Much of the valley was occupied, but the Soviets paid a heavy price; many soldiers were killed by mines and in ambushes. During one battle, on April 30 in the Hazara Valley, the 1st Battalion of the 682nd Motor Rifle Regiment was decimated: the losses of Soviet troops were estimated at 60 killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knyazev |first=Nikolai |url=http://artofwar.ru/k/knjazew_n_n/text_0010.shtml |title=''Гибель 1-го батальона 682-го мотострелкового полка 30 апреля 1984 года, ущелье Хазара (Панджшер)''('''In Russian''')|publisher=  ''http://artofwar.ru/''|accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Soviets, the operation was partly successful - some of the infrastructure of the Mujahideen, created in the time of the truce in 1982-1983, was destroyed. Babrak Karmal completed a propaganda visit to the Panjshir, which for some time had become a safe zone. However, it quickly became apparent that most of Massoud's forces had escaped the onslaught, and were still able to carry out their harassment tactics. Eventually, in September, the Soviet-DRA forces once again evacuated the Panjshir Valley, leaving occupying forces only in the lower Panjshir.&lt;ref&gt;Roy p.200&lt;/ref&gt;

Yousaf and Adkin reported in 1992 that the Soviet forces involved included the 180th Motor Rifle Regiment, battalions of the [[66th Motor Rifle Brigade]] and 191st Motor Rifle Regiment, a regiment of the [[103rd Guards Airborne Division]], a battalion of the [[345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment]], accompanied by Afghan forces including the [[8th Division (Afghanistan)|8th Division]], the [[20th Division (Afghanistan)|20th Division]], and the [[37th Commando Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;Brig. Mohammed Yousaf and Mark Adkin, 'The Bear Trap,' Leo Cooper, 1992, 70&lt;/ref&gt; It seems likely that the reference to the '180th Motor Rifle Regiment' refers to the 682nd Motor Rifle Regiment of the [[108th Motor Rifle Division]], based in [[Kabul]].

===Panjshir VIII - September 1984===

The 8th offensive was a follow-up to the 7th, involving mostly airborne forces.

===Panjshir IX - 16 June 1985===

The 9th offensive was carried out in reprisal for the destruction of the DRA garrison at Peshgur, during which Massoud's mobile groups took 500 prisoners including 126 officers and killed a [[brigadier]] of the Afghan Army.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Michael(2002); ''Massoud, de l'islamisme à la liberté''; Audibert; {{ISBN|2-84749-002-7}}, p.228&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoners had been marched into the mountains, where the Mujahideen claimed they were killed by a Soviet aerial bombardment, a claim others dubbed suspicious.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Initiated hours after the raid, the Soviet counter-attack installed a new garrison in Peshgur, and pursued the retreating Mujahideen. The group escorting the captured Afghan officers was caught in the open by Soviet helicopters, and in the ensuing fight most of the prisoners were killed, with both sides projecting on each other the responsibility for the incident&lt;ref&gt;Barry; p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

In 1986, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced his intention of withdrawing the Soviet contingent from Afghanistan. From then on the Soviets were mostly concerned with avoiding losses in the Panjshir sector, and they observed a tacit ceasefire: unprovoked shooting by Soviet troops was forbidden, and the Mujahideen refrained from attacking Soviet bases. Despite provocations ordered by [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]]'s government to draw the Soviets into further fighting, the situation generally remained calm, enabling Massoud to carry out his &quot;strategic offensive&quot;, capturing much of Baghlan and Takhar provinces. The last Soviet and Afghan troops present in the lower Panjshir were finally evacuated in June 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artofwar1&quot;/&gt;

== Revert demerger to [[List of rolls of arms]]  ==

I do not believe the above demerger should have taken place and that it should now be reverted to re-consolidate the article Roll of arms. The article Roll of arms was only a very short article and there was no need for a demerger. It has been shorn of its relevant detail and the new article is turning into a parallel article, developing a longer and longer intro, whilst the original article is developing its own list of rolls. A mess. Comments please. ([[User:Lobsterthermidor|Lobsterthermidor]] ([[User talk:Lobsterthermidor|talk]]) 13:14, 13 March 2015 (UTC))
:I viewed both articles, and consider the separation of the topic and list to be beneficial. To expand the article Roll of arms further, I expect it will become less British Isles centered probably through cross connection with similarly titled articles in other languages. There seems to be a continuity threads that have not been developed regarding military use, class-defining function, the natural fade in relevance in most republics, etc. In sum the article Roll of arms is start class because it is so sparse. I have great respect for Lobsterthermidor as I encounter his excellent work and improvements from time to time; remerging may make less work by allowing edits to be within one article rather than between articles. Yet removing the bulky List of rolls of arms may allow natural growth in the article Roll of arms by keeping External links and other elements. So my suggestion is to &quot;wait and see&quot; for a few years, while moving content from List of roll of arms to Roll of arms when appropriate[[Special:Contributions/68.32.154.213|68.32.154.213]] ([[User talk:68.32.154.213|talk]]) 16:17, 14 July 2015 (UTC).
::Thank you. I fear that what will happen is that we will have parallel expansion in both, with the &quot;list&quot; article's intro growing, and the original article's list growing. This will therefore require solving by a merger later down the line. The section &quot;Known historical examples&quot;, is surely a list, why wasn't this  split-off into the new &quot;list article&quot;? It's a bit of a mess. Your point re &quot;British Isles centered&quot; is a good one and suggests to me that it is now time to create a new article on English rolls so that the topic can be developed more freely. This might encourage those with a primary interest in non-English rolls to develop those areas too. On my to do list.([[User:Lobsterthermidor|Lobsterthermidor]] ([[User talk:Lobsterthermidor|talk]]) 13:11, 17 August 2015 (UTC))

I had not seen this, and I guess I am open to either merging or &quot;de-merging&quot;, the main problem was that the material was in poor shape, not whether it was kept on one or on two pages. 
Since there is very little material here, it is easier to develop it on a single page, but once we get a substantial expansion of the &quot;list&quot; portion, I suppose it would make sense to export it again. At present, if the &quot;list&quot; were to be split off, there would be no &quot;article&quot; left to speak of. 
If the material is developed by high quality additions, there will come a natural point where [[WP:SS]] becomes convenient. --[[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|(𒁳)]]&lt;/small&gt; 10:03, 27 April 2016 (UTC)
*I'm also new to this, but the current combined form seems clearly correct. If either or both portions get vastly larger the situation might change. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 19:45, 27 April 2016 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Through The Dragon's Eye Opening Credits.PNG|thumb|250px|Opening Credits of &quot;Through the Dragon's Eye&quot;]]

This is a list of episodes of ''[[Through The Dragon's Eye]]'' (a ten-part [[BBC]] [[Look and Read]] educational children's fantasy television programme). Each episode was about 20 minutes long. During the opening credits of &quot;Through the Dragon's Eye&quot; a book with the same title opened at a specific &quot;Chapter&quot; (for example, ''Chapter 1: The Dragon from Pelamar'').

==Chapter 1: The Dragon from Pelamar==

Three children (Jenny, Scott and Amanda) pass through a mural they have been painting and find themselves in the magical land of Pelamar. There, Gorwen the dragon tells them that the &quot;life source&quot; of Pelamar, the Veetacore has exploded. He then asks for their help to re-build it. They then travel to the Veetacore House and meet the Veetacore Keepers, Boris, Morris and Doris. The episode ends with Amanda finding out that three Veetons are missing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;br /&gt;The Dragon From Pelamar was Distributed in the [[UK]] on 19 September 1989.

==Chapter 2: Flight to Widge==

Gorwen the Dragon believes that the missing Veetons must have fallen beyond the mountains of Pelamar into the strange land of Widge. Amanda, Scott, Boris, Rodey and Gorwen set off to find the lost Veetons and the quest begins. Jenny stays behind with the other two Veetacore Keppers, Doris and Morris to help them read a book on how to put the Veetacore back together again.

Boris and Amanda crash land into a &quot;high fade zone&quot; of Widge and have to leave quickly because Rodey (a giant talking mouse) shrinks. When the air gets too thin for Boris and Gorwen to fly through the search party land at Border Camp in Widge. The Widgets (the native inhabitants of Widge – small squirrel-like animals) let them stay for the night. In the morning, they help Scott and Rodey as to which road they should take (Rodey could speak &quot;Widgen&quot; – the language of Widge).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Chapter 3: The First Veeton==

With the Widgets as their guides, the search party set off through the Woods of Widge. Jenny tries to contact Gorwen on a videophone to ask whether Boris took a &quot;veetarod&quot; with him (a long, thin instrument the Keepers use to locate Veetons with). Scott starts to suspect that the Widgets are not all that they seem, when Boris falls into a quagmire, which could have been avoided if Boris could have read the sign saying &quot;Danger! Quagmire!&quot;. Rodey the mouse goes off in a huff, and the others leave him to catch up with them. The veetarod (which Boris had taken with him) works and leads the party to a huge tree (unfortunately the door into the tree is locked).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Chapter 4: Word Magic==

The Widgets have hidden the first Veeton inside a huge book tree. Boris and Amanda manage to unlock it and enter it in search of the Veeton, while Scott and the dragon Gorwen search for Rodey, who is still missing. Boris and Amanda follow some signs to the library. Inside Boris solves a clue, and finds the first Veeton. The kindly Book Tree lets Boris take some books with him for when he can read. They find the way out and try contacting Doris with the news, however Doris never replies. The credits roll up on Doris with a huge look of shock and absolute terror on her face.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Chapter 5: Clues in the Snow==

With the help of the veetarod, Scott and Gorwen find Boris, Amanda and the first Veeton in a gravel pit (the exit of the Book Tree). Then it starts to snow. Scott finds a &quot;snowflake clue&quot;, which tells them to go to Ash Rock. They set out through the snow, however almost as soon as they set off, the Widgets corner them and engage them in a snowball fight. After the fight, which everyone enjoys, Scott, Boris and Gorwen find that the Widgets have taken the Veeton and Boris' rucksack, and that they have kidnapped Amanda. Gorwen sets off to find them, while Boris and Scott continue to Ash Rock.

Meanwhile, at the Veetacore House, we find out why Doris is not replying to Boris' message. Charn, the Evil One, an exiled Pelamot, has returned to try to take over Pelamar. Boris can only see the back of Doris' head in his videophone, and therefore thinks Doris is simply being rude when she cuts him off.  At the Veetacore House, Charn reveals his plan. When the Veetacore is mended, he will chant a spell, which must be chanted as the last Veeton is fitted, with malevolant words rather than the kind and hopeful ones at the back of the book. Jenny at first stands up to Charn, refusing to mend the Veetacore for his purposes, but he scares her into obedience by melting Frug, Morris' pet caterpillar, with his magic hands; if he points at something and keeps his hand on it, a jet of green light shoots out of his hand and melts the object he is pointing at.  He threatens to melt Morris as well, but Jenny decides it would be safer to help him after all. Doris tries to contact Boris as discreetly as possible, but Charn sees her at the last minute, and melts her.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Chapter 6: Jenny's Scarf==

Amanda chases the Widgets who stole Boris' rucksack (with the Veeton in it). She rescues it and in doing so, finds Rodey, but they find themselves lost in the snow. Boris and Scott find another clue at Ash Rock. They leave a sign for Amanda and Gorwen to follow. The veetarod then leads them up to the top of a mountain. When they are about halfway up, some rocks hit Boris on the head. One of the rocks is not a rock at all, it is a Veeton. Gorwen catches up with Amanda and Rodey and they continue up to the top of the mountain, where they treat Boris' head and contact Jenny again.

At the Veetacore House, Jenny persuades Charn to let Morris knit her a scarf. She continues to read the book for Charn, who cannot read, and re-builds the Veetacore. When the search party contact Jenny, she holds up Morris' scarf. On the scarf are the words &quot;HELP! CHARN!&quot; Gorwen decides to return to Pelamar alone, with the two Veetons. He leaves Rodey, Amanda, Boris and Scott to find the last Veeton by themselves.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Chapter 7: The Waterfall of Words==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;No-one can face Charn and live. Only Gorwen has a chance... &quot; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the night, the search party pitch a tent and spend the night at the top of the mountains. During the night, two troublesome Widgets sneak into the tent and steal Boris' map of Widge. They rip the map up, leaving Boris, Amanda, Scott and Rodey alone with no &quot;map, no time and no words to help&quot; them. Suddenly, a waterfall of words appears gushing down the mountainside, giving them a clue as what to do next.

Meanwhile, Gorwen makes his way back through Widge by night. He appears outside the Veetacore House, where he is seen by Jenny and Charn. Morris goes out the back door of the house to try and tell Gorwen.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Chapter 8: The Great Battle==

Gorwen returns to the Veetacore House, where Charn is waiting for him. Morris tries to warn him, but is zapped by Charn. There is a great battle and Charn is eventually beaten forever; Charn had already been beaten once by Gorwen and as a result was banished from Pelamar.

After the battle, Gorwen knows he still has time to save Morris, Doris, Frug and the rest of Morris' pets that Charn had melted, even though he, himself is becoming weaker and weaker. Doris then sends a message to Scott, Rodey, Amanda and Boris: Charn beaten but Gorwen fading. Hurry! Then Rodey finds a tunnel through the mountains.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Chapter 9: Danger on High==

Rodey rescues the veetarod, which had fallen down a deep chasm in the tunnel. The veetarod leads them up to the top of the mountain. Then Boris realises that the Widgets had taken his bat. Amanda persuades Boris to swap some of the books that the Book Tree had given him for the bat. The Widgets agree.

At the Veetacore House, the Veetacore is still unfinished. Frug meanwhile has become a very large cocoon and Gorwen has faded so much he is almost invisible. Jenny tries conatacting Boris to tell him to hurry up. Scott and Amanda spot the last Veeton balanced on a tree that has fallen over, wedged between two cliffs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Chapter 10: The Final Page==
{{rquote|right|&lt;small&gt;Power of Good,&lt;br&gt;Spread near and far,&lt;br/&gt;Power of Good,&lt;br/&gt;Bring Life to Pelamar.&lt;br/&gt;Banish evil Thoughts,&lt;br/&gt;Banish evil Ways,&lt;br/&gt;Make a world full of Good,&lt;br/&gt;From the Veetacore's Rays!&lt;/small&gt;|The Spell that needs to be chanted when the last Veeton is placed into the Veetacore.}}

{{rquote|right|&lt;small&gt;Power of ''Evil'',&lt;br&gt;Spread near and far,&lt;br/&gt;Power of ''Evil'',&lt;br/&gt;Bring ''Death'' to Pelamar.&lt;br/&gt;Banish ''good'' Thoughts,&lt;br/&gt;Banish ''good'' Ways,&lt;br/&gt;Make a world full of ''Evil'',&lt;br/&gt;From the Veetacore's Rays!&lt;/small&gt;|This is the version of the Spell that Charn was going to chant, if he had not been beaten by Gorwen, when the last Veeton was placed into the Veetacore.}}

Scott, with the help of the Widgets, manages to rescue the last Veeton. Boris, Amanda and Scott then start the long trek down to the bottom of the mountain after thanking and waving to the Widgets who make a banner for them out of a picnic cloth, which says ''&quot;Goodbye! Good Luck!&quot;'''.

Meanwhile, Doris and Morris fit the penultimate piece of the Veetacore and wait for the others to return with the last Veeton.

Boris, Amanda and Scott continue through the Woods of Widge until they reach Border Camp. Boris pulls out his magical flying bat and flies home to Pelamar with Scott and Amanda clasping onto the bat with him.

At the Veetacore House, Doris, Morris and Jenny gather round a cracked wall and measure the distance. They are convinced that it is getting bigger. A short while later, after Boris is shown encouraging his bat to go faster, Jenny measures the crack again, while Doris and Morris are asleep with Frug. Gorwen has almost vanished now; he is so pale.

The search party crash-land in Pelamar, miles away from the Veetacore House. To get to the house, Boris makes his cricket bat into a skateboard. They burst into the Veetacore House, on top of Doris, who had just declared that she did not believe that they were coming. They take out the Veeton and look for which way up it is supposed to go. Jenny looks in the book, which tells the Keepers how to fix the Veetacore, however she finds that Frug had eaten the last page.

Just then Frug erupts from his cocoon, revealing the last four words of the missing sentence in the book on each of his four wings. The Veetacore Keepers and the children work out what the sentence is and the last Veeton is placed, by Morris, Doris and Boris, into the Veetacore, while chanting the spell. The Veetacore glows and hums causing Gorwen to come back, Rodey to return to his normal size and the rest of Pelamar to fill with life again.

With their mission complete, the children return to their own world - only a short time after they left it. They all find a miniature veeton in their pockets as a gift from Pelamar - proving their adventure really did happen. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

If you came here because {{{1|somebody asked you to, or you read a message on a forum}}}, please note that '''this is not a ballot''', but rather a ''discussion'' to establish a consensus amongst Wikipedia editors on whether an article is suitable for this encyclopedia.  We have [[Wikipedia:Policy|policies and guidelines]] to help us decide this, and [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deletion decisions]] are made on the merits of the arguments, not by counting heads (or [[Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|socks]]).

You can participate and give your opinion.  Please [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign your posts]] on this page by adding &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the end.  ''Happy editing!''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Comments made by suspected [[Wikipedia:Single purpose account|single purpose accounts]] can be tagged using {{&lt;nowiki&gt;subst:&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''spa'''|''username''}}.&lt;/small&gt;
|}&lt;/div&gt;

{{ns:0|B}}
The reason I have marked all these articles to discuss for deletion is twofold.  The first one is the '''question of copyright'''.  Every article I have tagged has a [http://www.samurai-archives.com/dictionary/A1.html single source] ([http://www.samurai-archives.com/dictionary/A1.html http://www.samurai-archives.com/dictionary/A1.html] or later pages in that same source - for now I have only tagged the A's). In most cases it is also an uncited source. Regardless, the text of each of these articles is merely an exact duplicate with a few words changed around. In nearly every case, the content (meaning) and order of the content (meaning) is the same, even if some words have been changed.  Whether this is blatant copyright infringement or not may be questionable, but that is not the only issue.

'''Quality of scholarship'''
The second issue is quality and scholarship.  All of these articles only have that one source - the [http://www.samurai-archives.com Samurai Archives] website. In many cases, if not most, sources are not cited on that website.  Therefore, we can not verify the validity of the entries on that website.  One of the requirements of Wikipedia is that articles include information that is [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. Information taken from the Samurai Archives is not verifiable.  The simple fact of the matter is, aside from it not being verifiable, if there are any errors in information on that website, we are now propogating them all over the internet. This is because all of the articles I tagged are created only from information on the Samurai Archives website. That is just plain poor scholarship, and has been noted on other discussions regarding this, adding articles such as the ones I have tagged cheapens wikipedia and it cheapens the work that we do in adding information to it.  Another issue is that many, or possibly most, of the articles I tagged, have not been added to for months, which tells me that there is little information out there that can be used to supplement them.  So the issue of both verifiability and scholarship leads me to feel that these articles need to be eliminated.  The articles I have tagged are of low quality, and of almost no academic value, and I back that statement up with what I have written above.

There are over 100 articles almost identical in situation to the few that I have tagged here - and you will also notice that it is the same contributor on every article [[User_talk:Darin_Fidika| Darrin Fidika]] - he apparently been made aware of the situation many times over, but continues to blithely post articles of identical poor quality as those I have marked below.  That worries me.  He has been talked to many times according to his talk page, but he never stopped this activity.  

Sorry it took me so long to figure out how to go about all this, I have always been happy to just anonymously add information to wikipedia from work during slow times, but this issue, first brought forward a few days ago, really caught my attention as a major quality control issue that all of us who contribute to wikipedia need to pay attention to. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Monkeyheadster|Monkeyheadster]] ([[User talk:Monkeyheadster|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Monkeyheadster|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; 20:07, October 30, 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment:''' After looking through several of the articles listed above, I can see that one of the main sources was definitely Samurai Archives. However, '''all''' of the articles I looked at had '''more''' information than found in the Samurai Archives, leading me to believe there was at least one other source for the information. As all of these articles are quite short, it's understandable the information would be presented in similar ways—there are only so many ways to write 2-3 sentences. I do think the articles need to be sourced, however, so it can be more easily determined what information came from where. ···[[User:Nihonjoe|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;日本穣&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Help:Japanese|?]] · &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Nihonjoe|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;to&lt;/font&gt; [[User:Nihonjoe|Nihon]][[WP:JA|j]]o[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|'''&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;''']]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:10, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::Frankly, I disagree - what you are seeing is &quot;fluff&quot; added by the contributor - throwing in that such and such was a lord of such and such province because the province is mentioned later in the text.  It is one contributor, one known for this sort of thing, and frankly, I do not believe it can be argued that the only source is not the samurai archives, because it plainly is the only source - most of these articles only exist in the english language at the Samurai archives site, and I am most definately sure that Darrin is not translating his own information.  Here is a good example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Marume Nagayoshi]] Here is a good example of a typical &quot;entry&quot;: '''Samurai archives''' - Nagayoshi was a retainer of the Sagara family of Higo Province. He is said to have met the wandering swordsman Kamiizumi Nobutsuna and studied under him, later forming his own school of swordsmanship on Kyushu. '''Wikipedia''': Maruma Nagayoshi (1540-1629) was a retainer of the Japanese clan of Sagara of Hizen province during the Sengoku Period of the 16th century, extending to the 17th century of the Edo Period. It is said that Nagayoshi ran into the famous swordsman known as Kamiizumi Nobutsuna and began training under him. Nagayoshi later established his own school of swordsmanship at Kyūshū.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

::They are obviously the same.  You can see how he adds fluff by stating that it took place during the sengoku period - that most definately does not indicate an &quot;alternate source&quot; - he even goes so far as to add incorrect information to hide his plagiarism - he changes Higo province to Hizen province. 

::I challenge anyone here to come up with another source, preferably a book rather than the internet, due to the sad fact that Samurai Archives information has been propogating due to wikipedia all over the internet.  If there is a belief that multiple sources have been used, I challenge someone to provide one.

::However, that is only a small part of the issue - the issue of poor scholarship is much larger.  My argument above about poor scholarship stands. The unfortunate fact here is that we have let this go for 10 months now, and it has created a monster. People seem intimidated by having to remove over 100 articles, but any one of these articles on its own would be a solid candidate for deletion. We shouldn't let the volume of articles get in the way of objectivity in this matter. --[[User:Monkeyheadster|Monkeyheadster]] 21:18, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''Keep for now and tackle the problem differently''': there does seem to be a potential plagiarism issue here, but I do not think that AfD is the right way to tackle it. Five days is simply not sufficient time for people to check so many articles and confirm that your claim that they are ''all'' problematic. The AfD process was not designed to handle large-scale cases like this, and we run the risk of throwing babies out with bathwater.&lt;br /&gt;It would IMO be more appropriate to open a centralized discussion of the matter, possibly as a subproject of Wikiproject Japan, to give the full set of articles a proper consideration, establish which can be cleaned up and which cannot, and resubmit the unsalvageable articles for deletion with more than one editor's word for the claim that they need deleting.&lt;br /&gt;For example, it appears that in many cases there are articles on these people on the Japanese Wikipedia, which certainly will ''not'' be based on the Samurai Archives website, and which could thus almost certainly be used to salvage the English articles. &amp;mdash; [[User:Haeleth|Haeleth]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Haeleth|Talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:45, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It took me a mere 2 hours to confirm it. Not only is 5 days plenty of time, but this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. There are nearly 100 more articles that are the same as the ones I have already tagged. It is time that we take care of the issue that Darin Fidika has been allowed to create.  This has been discussed to little avail on LordAmeth's talk page and on the Japanese Military History task force talk page. Someone should have caught this months and months ago, and furthermore, the lone contributor must be brought to task for his actions.

::All of the articles listed are identical in format, and from the same contributor. None of them use more than once source. This is specifically why I chose these to tag. Because they are all essentially the same.  I believe they should be removed until such time as interested and responsible wikipedians can go through and create new entries with multiple sources.  

As it can't be disputed that the tagged articles are rewrites of articles from the samurai archives and no other sources were used, I do not believe this can be considered fair use of the material. These articles duplicate the information from the samurai archives while not adding anything new to them - they are mere copies with different wording. This has gotten way, way out of hand, and I think removing the articles until such time responsible and interested parties come along to do actual orginal work is best.  
--[[User:Monkeyheadster|Monkeyheadster]] 21:50, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''The precident is set''' - You will notice that the article called [[Hinarasu]] has been [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Hinarasu deleted].  The author (a contributor to  the samurai archives website) tagged it for copyright violation, made his case on the talk page, and it has been removed.  His article is representative of '''every''' article I have tagged here, and this precident should show that I am correct in my request for deletion of these articles. Yet again this was an article added by &quot;Darin Fidika&quot;.  --[[User:Monkeyheadster|Monkeyheadster]] 22:06, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''In Summary''' - I will summarize my points here, with detalied information standing above as the detailed talk.

# It can't really be argued - Darin got nearly every piece of information in the above articles from the Samurai Archives site, from the page I have listed. (See above quote from Marume Nagayoshi as an example).
# I do not belive this is &quot;fair use&quot; of the samurai archives information. &quot;Fair Use&quot; of information includes using multiple sources to pull together an orginal article - using any one source as a mere reference - &quot;one among many&quot;. These articles are not original. They are copies of the Samurai archives, with some changed words, and a little &quot;fluff&quot; (see above) to make them look different. Hoever, the content (ideas) is nearly identical, as is the presentation of the order. These are not original articles by any reasonable stretch of the imagination.  Furthermore, after checking the Samurai Archives forum, it has been made clear that all further research activity will stop on the page because of the wholesale gutting of the page by Darin Fidika. Understandable, I wouldnt want my hard work to be simply copied, pasted, and then a few words changed around and have it called an original work.
# The [[Hinarasu]] article. (see above) That article on wikipedia, placed here by Darin and taken from the Samurai Archives, was identical in form to all of the articles that I have noted here, and that one has been deleted.  That sets the precident that these articles are justified in being removed. In fact, the author of the original article who requested it be removed pointed out that Darin also incorporated errors into his wikipedia article in his attempt to &quot;hide&quot; his plagiarism. He did the same with his copy of the [[Marume Nagayoshi]] article I mentioned above. Notice how he changed the province name to Hizen province. This guy will go so far as add wrong information to hide his plagiarism.  That also needs to be addressed. I believe this could even be considered [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] and could potentially invalidate all of his &quot;contributions&quot;.
# Scholarship issues. Since these articles all do come from the samurai archives (with minor fluff and a few changed words), and they have not been edited hardly at all since they have been posted to wikipedia, that tells me that either there are no other sources to pull together, or at this time there is no one interested in doing so. Therefore, I believe that it is in the best interest of wikipedia to delete them until such time as more responsible and interested users can pull together multiple sources to create new, original articles. No one has added information in 10 months, so it is highly unlikely that enough, or even any, information will be added to change the state of these articles.
# Error propogation.  Any errors made by the samurai archives site has now been moved to wikipedia, because no other sources have been used. There are references to &quot;Uzu&quot; castle, an accidental mistake on the samurai archives (recently brought to attention on that forum), and now &quot;Uzu&quot; castle has made it's way to wikipedia - and from there, all over the internet. It is actually &quot;Uozu&quot; castle, but wikipedia has secured it's place in hisotory now as &quot;Uzu&quot;. Not to mention Darin Fidika adding false information into the articles he copies to help hid his plagiarism.
# Verification. One of the requirements of wikipedia is that included information be verifiable. The samurai archives for the most part does not cite sources. Since Darin has been using the SA exclusively, he is essentially using an unverifiable source.  This is not good, and throws into question the quality of wikipedia itself if such articles are allowed to stay. Even where sources are listed, since Darin is only using one source (the samurai archives), the info he is pasting and changing words on has not been verified by him. His &quot;addition&quot; of [[Hinarasu]] further goes to show that he is not above adding errors into his articles to hide his plagiarism.
# Darin Fidika.  Darin has a history of problems as evidenced by his talk page. It is very clear that he is incapable of utilizing sources correctly, and has a documented history of plagiarism.  He is unfortunately incapable of creating an original article using multiple sources.  Is he a &quot;bad&quot; person? No, I don't think so. Is he misdirected? Probably. What can't be disputed is that his information comes strictly from the samurai archives - he has stated as much on his talk page, saying &quot;I did not realize that meager articles needed citations&quot;, and has also said he has taken from the samurai archives.  Comparing his articles to the link to the samurai archives I provided shows that he just copied it, and changed words around. Like I mentioned, he has a history of questionable behavior, and has admitted to taking info from the samurai archives.  As far as contributors go, he appears incapable of scholarship, and that alone throws any of his articles into a questionable light.
# Wikipedia quality. Keeping these articles would be a severe disservice to wikipedia, and also sets the precident that it is OK to steal, as long as you try to hide it by changing some words around.  '''Maybe''' what I have tagged is not true ''outright'' copyright violation (most are certainly plagiarism), however my other points alone are more than enough to justify removing these articles. It is the right and moral thing to do.
# Precident. We need to set the precident that scholarship and research is expected, and that plagiarism and unverified information is not.  It states clearly that &quot;Content that violates any copyright will be deleted. Encyclopedic content must be verifiable. You agree to license your contributions under the GFDL.&quot; on the edit page.  We need to stand by this. We have allowed this to go on for 10 months, and now we have to deal with a monster - over 100 uncited, unverifiable, plagiarized, low quality articles. It would be a simple matter if this had been tackled long ago, but we are dealing with it now, and qualms about the number of required deletions should not cloud objective judgement.

I believe that each and every one of my points have merit, and and every one alone justifies removing the pages.  Please don't try to debate a single point while ignoring the rest. I believe, however, that removing the articles is the right thing to do, again, until such time that responsible and interested parties can come up with orginial article from multiple verifiable sources.  I believe we should be working together here to make wikipedia a good place for information.  I hope my belief that we can and should make wikipedia a better place for information is justified. Because, by leaving these articles copied by Darin up, we are hurting the quality, and the reputation of wikipedia - both as a source, and as a place where plagiarism and bad scholarship is not tolerated.

*'''Strong delete''' - This is absolutely ridiculous. Such blatant plagarism should be stamped out. This is copyrighted work.

Wikipedia shouldn't about breaking honest rules to make our lives easier. [[User:John Smith's|John Smith&amp;#39;s]] 23:16, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

I really appreciate your backup on this. It truly '''is''' ridiculous. I have been working for 3 or 4 days to bring this to someone's attention.  I fully agree with you - '''NO ONE''' will volunteer to improve these, and so keeping them up just hurts wikipedia.  We do have a problem here, however - There are over 100 more articles in an identical situation as these. How do you recommend I move forward with the rest of it? --[[User:Monkeyheadster|Monkeyheadster]] 23:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:I'm not sure why you &quot;worked 3 or 4 days to bring this to someone's attention,&quot; when a simple post on the [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Japan]] page would have gotten someone's attention. Almost all of the articles you mentioned are listed as part of the project on their talk pages (and have been for months). Additionally, I think you're hurting this AfD by posting a novelette in explanation when a few concise statements would have sufficed. Most people who participate in AfD don't want to have to spend 15 minutes reading the AfD, and I don't know any who want to spend 2-3 hours perusing and comparing ''all'' the articles that are part of just this one AfD when they have many others to go through daily (have you ever spent time going through the AfD pages? They fill up very quickly.) ···[[User:Nihonjoe|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;日本穣&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Help:Japanese|?]] · &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Nihonjoe|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;to&lt;/font&gt; [[User:Nihonjoe|Nihon]][[WP:JA|j]]o[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|'''&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;''']]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:16, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been done [[User_talk:LordAmeth|User Talk LordAmeth]] and [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Military_history/Japanese_military_history_task_force|Japanese Military History Task Force]]. The &quot;3 or 4 days&quot; were at these places. When nothing came of it, it was time to force the issue.  As for the &quot;novel length&quot;, I believe most people want a cogent argument and justification for removing 40 articles, and the literate members, I am sure, will appreciate it.  I do appreciate you admitting that you con't care about the quality of wikipedia's articles or have any interest to put in the time that I and others are in order to guarantee quality ''(don't want to have to spend 15 minutes reading the AfD, I don't know any who want to spend 2-3 hours perusing and comparing ''all'' the articles that are part of the AfD.)'' but like myself, everyone else that does care about the major quality control issue we are facing will be glad to help out.  Thanks for the input, it is appreciated, but rather than attack me, I believe we have a major quality issue here to deal with.

If you are not interested in putting in the time to maintain that quality, your negativity really doesn't help things. ---[[User:Monkeyheadster|Monkeyheadster]] 00:31, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
:::Please keep the mind-reading to yourself, as you aren't very good at it. Please show me where I wrote I didn't care about the quality of Wikipedia? As for spending time here, I imagine I've spent a far cry more time than you on Wikipedia. I've spent countless hours cleaning up articles, writing new ones, translating them from the Japanese Wikipedia, and generally helping out. So do most of the people who take time to go through AfDs, and I can tell you that many people will just skip over an AfD that's so huge right at the beginning. Maybe you have all the time in the world to spend here, but the rest of us have jobs, families, and lives outside of Wikipedia, and don't spend all our waking moments here. Therefore, my point was that it is a good idea to try to keep your reasons for posting an AfD concise so that it receives more attention from more AfD patrollers. It was just a friendly suggestion to keep in mind, so please don't take it negatively. I've adjusted my comments above to be more clear on what I meant. ···[[User:Nihonjoe|&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;日本穣&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Help:Japanese|?]] · &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Nihonjoe|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;to&lt;/font&gt; [[User:Nihonjoe|Nihon]][[WP:JA|j]]o[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|'''&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;''']]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 01:01, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''Strong Delete'''-I'm the one whose [[Hinarasu]] article got stolen. Since that was my research--no one else checked my sources or checked to see what I had was accurate.

*'''Delete''' per nom.  In each individual case, the text is changed a reasonable amount.

**'''Comment''': Let me add that the most troubling of these are the ones where there is hardly any information.

*'''Definately Delete''' -- I am in a state of shock and awe that a single user was allowed to plagarize to this extent, even after repeated warnings. I have compared at least 15 articles, side by side with two browser windows - in one I have the orignal source, the other I have the wikipedia &quot;article&quot;.  For all intents and purposes, even if he changed the words, the articles are identical. This is something of a minor scandal, and I suggest that we take care of this by removing these articles, and by disciplining the culprit. What I find most disturbing is that there are apparently over a hundred articles that this one user has put up that will now have to be taken down. --[[User:63.164.145.198|63.164.145.198]] 03:49, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
**You might want to read [[WP:AGF]].  Truth is, these are very short entries, and often the WP article has a lot more in it than the source.

*'''I agree - delete''' Funny, the night I decide to create an actual login after contributing tidbits here and there, I am shown that I have been a moron. Rather than researching facts, I should have been taking a source, change some words around, and create a new article with it. Yeah, that's the ticket!  These articles should be deleted.  The arguments for deletion by all involved are pretty much ironclad. I think that if the user had done the exact same thing, but had put it within a larger article, that probably would have been acceptable. However, this user didnt do that.  He started countless articles from one source, which is plagiarism in my book. I've only looked at a few, but the ones that I have looked at have not been touched in months, except for the occasional additon of Japanese in the entry.  I think this user really wanted to increase his standing by creating all sorts of articles. I think it must have been calculated, because it appears that he has also been adding in fake or false information in his wikipedia entries to cover his tracks. That is simply dishonest.

*'''Delete (and possibly relist in JapMilHist)'''.

If it pulled together the original sources to create these articles, that would be a different story.  (Having a single source is also problematic for notability issues.)  I'd rather wipe these and restart afresh, this time taking proper care.  This might mean a smaller amount of material in a longer amount of time, but it also means safety for Wikipedia.

***I've removed the AfD tags from [[Hosokawa Fujitaka]], [[Hosokawa Tadaoki]], and [[Hosokawa Yoriyuki]]: you shouldn't add new articles to an AfD unless you started that AfD, and you didn't start this on.  Also, you suspect them of being copied from the &quot;samurai wiki&quot; section of samurai archives, which isn't the same thing as the larger concern in this debate.  In fact, according to the history link on those articles, they were created on the Samurai Wiki in September of this year while all the articles on Wikipedia are older.  Our articles aren't copyright violations: theirs are (since they are not licensing the info under the [[GFDL]].)

****I've gone and made sure there are attributions on that site to Wikipedia in these articles, and raised this as a general issue.  Hopefully they'll change their site to a GFDL license.

*****Mangojuice. Check the user who added the Hosokawa bios to wikipedia. Yep. Same user who stole the rest of the above. Look at the Samurai Archives site (biographical dictionary). You will see them on the site. Members of the Samurai Archives have been copying and pasting that work into the SamuraiWiki, which is OWNED by Samurai Archives. Therefore, you just claimed that Darin Fidika had original work concerning these biographical entries that have been on the Samurai Archives site, copyrighted 2005. I see a major problem there....Do you know why wikipedia articles are older? Because Darin copied and pasted them from the Samurai Archives site months and months ago, while the SamuraiWiki is a new venture, where the old S-A information is being transferred over. I would know...I've been a part of the transfer. So that would be great if you could remove that information you just added. In case you don't believe me, check the Samurai Archives detailed update log. Here is a copy of pertinent information:  &quot; 01-15-2000 -Added descriptions for Hattori Hanzo, Hosokawa Fujitaka, and Goto Mototsugu&quot;. That's older than wikipedia.

:::MangoJuice, you should be ashamed of yourself - I just saw this string.  Those articles you claim came from wikipedia came from the samurai archives main page, what was originally called the &quot;famous Samurai&quot; page, which I then personally moved to the samurai wiki. Those articles have been up for years. You are again proving that wikipedia has been stealing from me.  Here is the main page, first online in early 2000: http://www.samurai-archives.com/warrior.html

These biographies, which have been online at the samurai archives for at least 6 years, were the ones that have been recently moved to the samurai wiki. Since '''I''' own the copyright, I have full right to move them. I research Japanese resources, I would ''never'' even consider taking any of the worthless information from wikipedia, as most of the info on wikipedia is here by my or my associate, by proxy.  These are the original articles that you 'claim' were taken from wikipedia, when the reality is, they have been on my website for 6 years, researched by me and my associate:

*http://www.samurai-archives.com/fujitaka.html
*http://www.samurai-archives.com/tadaoki.html
*http://www.samurai-archives.com/yoriyuki.html

Also, here are the original battles, also up for at least 5 years, take a look at any matching wikipedia entry, I assume that they will be similar, because my site has been gutten and raped by wikipedia for years, mostly without attribution:

*http://www.samurai-archives.com/battles.html

'''This''' is what happens when wikipedia is lax with its standards. It gets '''me''' accused of stealing my '''own''' work.  I am drafting a letter to wikipedia's legal representative now, so do me a favor and leave up all of these articles that have been tagged for deletion, so that the lawyers will be able to see the violations when they get my letter.--[[User:Kuuzo|Kuuzo]] 18:09, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
**Yes, I have been corrected in my mistake by Nagayeri.  My response to him was, basically, oops.  I acknowledge that the material in question is clearly not stolen from Wikipedia, more like the other way around.  I was simply going on the assumption that the history link on one of those particular files on the Samurai wiki was the true revision history of the file there, but that was false, so I apologize.  As I said to Nagayeri, I am happy to assist in deleting ALL of these copyright violations once the AfD comes to a close.  In this case, I had some evidence that I was mistaken about, and I apologize for that, but it was an honest mistake.  (I would have amended my comments on the Samurai wiki too, but I've been blocked there, so I guess I can't.)  Truly, this is not so much a failing of Wikipedia as it is an example of the nasty consequences of copyright violations in the first place.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:29, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

*Look, mangojuice and everyone else. I am sorry if I come off as beligerent and angry. But, frankly, I am.  I and my associate worked our asses off for 3 years researching and translating to put together the Samurai Archives, and now someone has the gall to tell me that I'm stealing my own work. I think you can understand the position that puts me in. I truly appreciate all the people here who have fought for me. I just want these articles off wikipedia.  I am willing to eventually go in to wikipedia and contribute- and if you look at my contributions, I in fact have made a few contributions in the past, but I absolutely have to protest when our work is stolen wholesale and not even attributed.  I am perfectly fine with having my work used as a resource among many, in fact I would be honored that my website could be one contributor among many (a term used here before, I see), but I protest my work being stolen.  Again, Mango et all, I apologize for my tone today, but I think you can understand.  --[[User:Kuuzo|Kuuzo]] 18:24, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

** I for one totally understand.  Darin himself has even made some comments suggesting that he will help adjust the contents to address this issue; see [[User talk:Darin Fidika]].  In fact, your response to this leads me to change my own vote here to a ''strong'' delete; this situation is way past the point of being unacceptable.

Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Divo.gif]].  Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated.  Images need to have an [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image tag]] applied to the [[Wikipedia:Image description page|image description page]] indicating the copyright status of the image.  This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.

==Oldest Saint John's Arms?==
Is the symbol on 1000 years old wooden ski foun from Finland the oldest Saint John's Arms symbol known? By the way Finland was not yet fully Christianised that time so it was probably a pagan symbol. [[User:193.65.112.51|193.65.112.51]] 14:36, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, the symbol on the wooden ski in Finland is about 1000 years old. The description on the Finnish antiquities webpage says that it dated from the Viking era, which would imply pagan symbolism to me too. (If you view the image, you'll note that it was rotated 90 degrees from the cruciform version of the symbol. That isn't especially relevant though.) Although Finland was (presumably) not Christianized as of 1000 A.D., the name for the symbol isn't specified on the Finnish museum page. Your point is well taken! I would guess that the historical text book that was also cited in this article describes why the term Saint John's Arms symbol is associated with the wooden ski symbol. I cannot confirm that, as I don't read Finnish.  --[[User:FeralOink|FeralOink]] ([[User talk:FeralOink|talk]]) 20:48, 9 May 2013 (UTC)

This is simply a Christianized name for the symbol, it has much more history and numerous other names. I think the choice of this name is very arbitrary and misleading.

== Finnish ski image reference ==

I changed the URL for the wooden ski. I also created a separate reference, with citation template of type web for it, rather than bare linking to the image from within the article. If the URL that I used was less persistent or otherwise problematic, here is the original URL:

This ought to be renamed to looped square. Redirect whatever to it, but the current name is bias as can be.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:TrystynAlxander|TrystynAlxander]] ([[User talk:TrystynAlxander|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/TrystynAlxander|contribs]]) 22:45, 27 February 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
: +1. The name &quot;Saint John’s arms&quot; is appropriate (if at all) only where culture with Christian affinity prevails. &quot;Looped square&quot; is neutral regarding culture and is the term used e.g. in the Tennessee Encyclopedia cited in the article for the Missisippi culture specimens. German uses the similar term &quot;Schleifenquadrat&quot; (&quot;Schleifen&quot;=loops, &quot;Quadrat&quot;=square). -- [[User:Karl432|Karl432]] ([[User talk:Karl432|talk]]) 23:07, 27 February 2014 (UTC)

[[File:Tulip agenensis ZE.jpg|thumb|A [[Tulipa agenensis|Tulip]] photo taken with the DMC-FZ50, without [[raster graphics editor]] processing, shows the vivid colors produced by the camera.]]

'''Panasonic [[Lumix]] DMC-FZ50''' is a [[superzoom]] [[Bridge camera|bridge digital camera]] by [[Panasonic]]. It is the successor of the [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ30]].

While the [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ30|FZ30]] was a major upgrade of the [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20|FZ20]] both internally and externally, the FZ50 differs relatively little from the FZ30. The main differences are:
* Higher resolution 10.1-megapixel CCD
* Venus Engine III processor (with its characteristic unusual noise reduction algorithm)
* 2.0-inch flip-out 207k high resolution LCD (FZ30 has 235k)
* TTL Flash hot-shoe

The camera is known for its high-quality optics and effective optical [[image stabilization]] system. Many professional reviews have commended it for its excellent pictures at ISO 100, but it has a reputation for excessively &quot;smeary&quot; noise reduction at higher ISO settings, a problem that can be ameliorated by using the RAW capture mode. It uses proprietary [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]]. There is no storage built into the camera; an MMC, SD, or SDHC memory card is required. High-speed SD cards up to 2 GB and SDHC cards up to 32GB are supported.

The camera has many SLR-like handling features&amp;nbsp;— dual control wheels for aperture and shutter speed, manual focus (focus-by-wire) and zoom rings, and a flash hot shoe. It is among the largest non-SLR cameras built, and is positioned at the high end of the bridge-camera market.

Zooming while recording movies is supported since the zoom is manual. The camera also includes an &quot;extended optical zoom&quot; system providing greater optical zoom ability when shooting at lower resolutions, giving up to 19.3× zoom at 3MP. Essentially, this just crops the center out of the image in-camera, but can be useful for metering and framing purposes. Apertures from {{f/}}2.8 to {{f/}}11 are supported, though the largest apertures are not available at high zoom levels ({{f/}}3.7 at full zoom). Shutter speeds range from 60 &lt;abbr title=&quot;second&quot;&gt;s&lt;/abbr&gt; to 1/2000 s, although shutter speeds faster than 1/1000 s are not available at the widest apertures. Several different auto-focus modes are available. The AF-macro setting can be selected for all camera modes. Macro capability is not outstanding (5&amp;nbsp;cm minimum focal range at 1× zoom), and the tele-macro capability present on the lower-end Panasonic FZ models (the ability to focus down to 1&amp;nbsp;m at 420&amp;nbsp;mm) is not present; the FZ50 can only focus down to 2&amp;nbsp;m at 420&amp;nbsp;mm. However, the FZ50 is commonly used to record high-magnification macro images with an inexpensive conversion lens; the most commonly used lens for this purpose is the 8-[[Dioptre|diopter]] Raynox 250.

The FZ50 has a screw mount to accept 55&amp;nbsp;mm filters, and is compatible with a wide variety of Panasonic-branded and third-party lens converters which can provide greater wide-angle, telephoto and close-up capabilities. 

The FZ50 can also record in a RAW format which is supported by [[Adobe Photoshop#Plugins|Adobe Camera Raw]] and the free [[UFRaw]] plugin for [[GIMP]] and many other third-party programs; the camera comes with a special version of [[Silkypix]] for conversion. RAW files are recorded in around three seconds with fast SD cards, which is one of the best results among non-[[digital single-lens reflex camera]]s; however, there is no RAW buffer as on many digital SLR's. Unlike its predecessors, the FZ50 does not support TIFF format.

The zoom and focus mechanism is internal: the lens does not physically extend beyond the camera housing when focusing and zooming.  Startup is under one second, as the lens does not need to be extended.

== Bot problems ==

Hi, it seems to me that {{User|VoABot II}} isn't working properly. Any rollback or equivalent that reverts edits (plural) by X to last version by Y should result in a diff that shows that the vandalism reversion and Y's last version are identical.  On the article {{Article|Love}}, we had the following:

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Love&amp;diff=83033279&amp;oldid=83027898 17:32, 22 October 2006] edit from [[User:65.189.203.107|65.189.203.107]]

If you look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Love&amp;diff=83055132&amp;oldid=83033279 the diff] that compares VoABotII's version with the version that it said it was reverting back to, you'll see that it missed some of the vandalism. It seems to have caught the first vandalism but not the second.

==Delete link after moving?==
While cleaning up after a number of pagemove vandals, tonight, it occurred to me that it'd be nifty to have a way to quickly delete the &quot;on wheels!&quot; redirects left over. Adding a delete button to the page we see ''after'' moving a page seems a likely candidate; since I'm not aware of a way to segregate between admin/non-admin in MediaWiki text pages, it seems a job for Javascript. Thoughts? [[User:Luna Santin|Luna Santin]] 05:13, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
:The &quot;move successful&quot; link has a link to the old page, which can be deleted from there. As for accounts with many vandals moves, I may change &quot;revert all moves&quot; to delete the vandal locations.'''[[User talk:Voice of All|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Voice&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;-of-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;All&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 05:49, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

== Calvin and Hobbes page ==

Hello,

I posted the entry below on the 'Calvin and Hobbes' page and the BOTS keeps removing it. Why? My addition to the page was written as follows: 

1.) A photo of the only exsiting plush doll of the character Hobbes (calvin and hobbes comic strip) 

2.) A small description of how much the comic strip is loved by fans, that they even make their own related items such as this one and only hobbes doll ever to be created.

Due to the mass out-pour of Calvin and Hobbes fan requests, I simply added this photo of the toy  on the Calvin and Hobbes page so everyone who hadn't seen the rare doll, finally had the chance to. 

Below is what I added, it keeps getting removed by the BOTS for some reason. Can you please add it back or fix this problem?:


'''===Fan Made items==='''

''Here is a hand-made plush doll of the character Hobbes the tiger from the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip. No Calvin and Hobbes merchandise has or ever will be released by the comic's creator Bill Watterson, so this one was hand-made by a fan in April of 2006. This is the only Hobbes doll known to exist.''
[[Image:Hobbes doll.PNG|thumb|Fan-made plush Hobbes doll inspired by the Calvin &amp; Hobbes comic. This is the ONLY one known to exist. (Click image for full view)]]

hey, whoever posted this, you should know that there is not only one homemade hobbes in this world. i have searched a little online and i found that there are 9 (that are easy to find anyway). if you want to see them go to the Calvin and Hobbes page in Wikipedia then the bottom of merchandising to see the pictures.

==Specialized help needed==
Hello.  [[User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me]] suggested that you may be able to help revert some vandalism from the 152.163.100.xxx range.  Someone using a rotating IP, never using the same IP to hit two different articles, was linkspamming our articles to their Encyclopaedia Britannica equivalents.  From the article names it is clear they were working their way alphabetically, and had only gotten into the &quot;Ab___&quot; range before they were blocked.  I reverted the ones I saw, but I'm sure there were articles hit by this linkspammer that I can't locate because they are too far back in the Recent Changes list.  Is there any way to locate earlier edits by that IP range so those edits can be reverted as well?  Thank you.  [[User:SWAdair|SWAdair]] 09:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== [[Maria Pia of Saxe Coburg Braganza]] ==

I have never see an encyclopedia where a pretender is declared false or impostor without insert the impartial and legal source. Also for this is correct and neutral delete in the pretender wikipage [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretender]] the affirmation against Rosario Poidimani, the heir of Maria Pia, as false pretender. Infact the last news in this dispute is the Portuguese Government has officially decides [ see   http://www.parlamento.pt/plc/requerimento.aspx?req_id=36925] to not &quot;legitimize&quot; any pretenders because the Portugal is a Repubblic and so it can't enter in this matter. This decision is obtained after the request of the president of the People's Monarchist Party (Partido Popular Monárquico) against the abuse of power of the portuguese ambassador in Italy that the last year declared Duarte Pio is the legitimate pretender in Portugal. At the end there are not impartial sources that judge Maria Pia and Rosario as false pretender, so if some users insert this affirmation this is only a NPOV or their personal points of view (at the contrary please insert here the impartial and official source of this). Many royalist in Portugal affirm the only fake and false Duke of Braganza and pretender in Portugal is Duarte Pio of Braganza [ http://duarteotretas.blogspot.com/ ]. At the end I think is appropriate insert in the wiki page of this pretender the name Maria Pia of Saxe Coburg Braganza and not Hilda Toledano. Hilda Toledano is only a pseudonym as writer but here we discuss of her claims and in all her official documents is reported only the name Maria Pia de Saxe Coburg Braganza. This is other NPOV attempt to denigrate this pretender in order to favour Duarte Pio. Please help for a neutral encyclopedia. [[User:Justiceiro|Justiceiro]] 18:00, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

== VoABot II needs to look into history before reverting ==

Just noticed the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_chemistry&amp;action=history reversion in History of Chemistry]. Exactly how automatic is this bot? I ask because I see the same user (anonIP) had made two successive vandalisms, but the reversion was a literal &quot;revert to previous version&quot; not &quot;previous version by someone else&quot;, so half the crap remained. A common vandal (or to be generous, newbie test) trick is to make a random change and then self-revert. From the outside, that &quot;last edit&quot; often looks like vandalism, so reverting it actually reinstates the real vandalism. That's bad. [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] 06:49, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
:Note the revision #84176351 was by user 128.97.138.78. The bot creates the summary based on the URL of the page it was saving (e.g &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_chemistry&amp;oldid=84176351&quot;). It then saves, so that should have been correct.'''[[User talk:Voice of All|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Voice&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;-of-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;All&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 06:53, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
::I don't know quite what you're saying there. The page it saved with that edit summary [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_chemistry&amp;diff=84989153&amp;oldid=84176351 does not match] the version mentioned in the summary. It actually looks like it was the ''second'' edit that got ignored. Perhaps the second one occurred while the bot was processing the first, so it didn't get noticed. That is, the bot exactly reverted the first vandalism edit instead of reverting to the specific version it claimed? [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] 07:54, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
:::It did loaded the correct revision and saved. I talked to devs on #mediawiki and the problem is that the IP must have edited the page while the bot was reverting the first edit, the server tried to merge the IP's second vandal edit with mine, as mine was a second older and so it stored a version that the bot never actually saved.'''[[User talk:Voice of All|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Voice&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;-of-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;All&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 16:47, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Ah! I forgot to check. But wait, can't I add the IPs for ''only'' specific pages (and not all the pages in the bot's watchlist)?

''You blocked our Texas Instruments proxy IP ranges as if we vandels. I think there must be a mistake. All traffic from TI will come from 192.91.75.0-128.

Hi, there is a continuous vandalism by the anonymous [[195.93.21.41]] in [[Hilda Toledano]] page, [[pretender]] page, and [[Duke of Braganza]] page. This anonymous, a big supporter of the other portuguese pretender [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza]] continue with his libel against the pretender Maria Pia of Saxe Coburg Braganza, aka Hilda Toledano, and continue to insert in these page Maria Pia as impostor or false pretender in order to favour the pretender Duarte Pio. These are only his personal point of view and so is not possible in this encyclopedia he continue to libel Maria Pia and her heir. Please help in this situation and block this anonymous.

Admin Coaching, now being coordinated by [[User:HighwayCello|HighwayCello]], is a program for people who want help learning some of the more subtle aspects of Wikipedia policy and culture. People are matched with experienced users who are willing to offer coaching. The program is designed for people who have figured out the basics of editing articles; they're not newcomers any more, but they might want some help in learning new roles. In this way, Esperanza would help keep hope alive for Wikipedia because we would always be grooming the next generation of admins.

Hey mate

You may or may not recall I mentioned that AfD's were using the {{tl|la}} template within them. Well yesterday I suggested that we switched to {{tl|la-admin}} as it adds a deletion link, handy for clear deletes. It seems the community has accepted the idea with all subsequent using it. 

Well, I've updated ''my'' userspace copy of your Deletion script so it now uses {{tl|la-admin}} and also adds category template that has also been used for some time. If its help the replacement lines below the ''AfD is already at this location'' warning is

&lt;pre&gt;
            }
          else

I am a freelance writer working on an article about the wide array of people who make Wikipedia their life, their passion, their pastime. Wikipedia “addicts” if you will. I'm also looking at all the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; goings on at Wikipedia that the average reader of the site never knows about. I intend on focusing a little on several of the unofficial Wikipedia organizations that members are a part of such as Esperenza et al. As such, I would like to speak to you about your experience as an adminstrator, specifically your involvement in the Admin Coaching program. If you are interested in participating, please email me at brianwrites@gmail.com.  [[User:FFFearlesss|FFFearlesss]] 20:25, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

Can you think of any reason why my version of the script has become broken recently? I wiped my monobook and re-subst'd the script from your page, having cleared my cache God knows how many times. Is this a problem you know about, or have I done something wrong? —[[User:Vanderdecken|Vanderdecken]]∴ &lt;b&gt;[[User talk:Vanderdecken|∫]][[Special:Emailuser/Vanderdecken|ξ]][[Special:Contributions/Vanderdecken|φ]]&lt;/b&gt; 16:04, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

==Cristiano Ronaldo==
I noticed a couple days ago you unprotected the Cristiano Ronaldo page. The reason why it was semi-protected in the first place was because it was a high risk article for vandalism. Apparently it hasn't changed much since you unblock it. I think it's time to put the semi-protection back. [[User:Kingjeff|Kingjeff]] 20:10, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

== I need your bot ==

We have a problem with a persistent vandal who has a grudge against user:Chuq and admin:Longhair for reverting unsourced POV changes he wanted to make to  a couple of article.  Now he posts a few times a day from random IP addresses all over the world which he claims are open proxies or network servers configured with the factory default password.  It is possible to set VoA bot II to watch for him?  Also, can the bot report the IP addresses used somewhere?

Here are some typical edits [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Life_Line_%28Voyager_episode%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89210038]

== VoA scripts ==

Hey, I'm a fellow admin who uses your monobook javascripts, and I just had a question. When I'm at [[WP:RFPP]], I frequently use your &quot;sysop response&quot; for quick replies. However, for some strange reason, I could no longer see that button when I was responding to RFPP's. Also, it seems I can no longer automatically protect pages by clicking on my toolbox when I am editing an article. Any reason why that happened?

===Another script===
Hi, VoA.  Speaking of scripts, we have been discussing a change in the archiving system for RfAs.  Mainly, the page [[Wikipedia:Recently created admins]] is usually way too long, something that people have often complained about.  So, in a thread started by [[User:J Di|J Di]], we have started discussing breaking down the archive (pages that are no longer transcluded are moved to the archive, with a link to the RfA and the date when the RfA was closed), creating subpages by year and leaving in the main page only links to those pages.  I have also proposed limiting the number of simultaneous transclusions to the page to 4 or 5.  I was still waiting to see if anyone was going to disagree with the format proposed or propose something else before I mentioned this to you, but since it's been already brought up in the discussion, whereas no opposition to the proposed changes have been raised, I thought that I might as well ask you if you would like to go through the discussion ([[Wikipedia talk:Recently created admins#Transclusion?|here]]) in order to assess what that might entail for your scripts for semi-automated closing of RfAs, which some Bureaucrats use :-) .  No changes will be effected until we can design a plan to make any necessary changes in an orderly, swiftly manner, in order to minimize the inconvenience to those using the script.  So, whenever you have a little time, let us know.  Cheers,  [[User:Redux|Redux]] 18:41, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
:Its usually easier to make the script once I visually see how the page will be setup exactly. You may want to go ahead with it and I'll cache up.

== [[User:Dan100]] ==

Hi. I'm writing because user Dan100 has a habit of making very drastic, knee-jerk changes to articles, while completely ignoring ongoing debates on article talk pages. 

He recently (yesterday) took it upon himself to effectively delete a mid-length article ([[Street Thunder]]) and merge it with the [[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)]] article, despite the fact that a convincing argument had been made to keep the to two articles separate and that the matter seemed to be closed. 

I reverted his changes and left a note on his talk page and on the Assault on Precinct 13 talk page. However, I noticed that this user has a history of ignoring talk page debates and doing whatever he feels like doing. At least two other users before me have cited him for the same thing, yet he persists in making drastic changes to articles regardless of what the prevailing opinion on the talk pages may be.
[[User:Sullenspice|Sullenspice]] 15:59, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:The fictional gang article does seem a bit weak on its own, and the movie is not really notable enough to have a set of subpages. Its a close call, and the seperate page is not doing to much harm where it is. I am not sure what you are implying I should do about Dan100 though.'''[[User talk:Voice of All|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Voice&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;-of-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;All&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 18:56, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

Granted, the Street Thunder article could definitely stand to be improved, but the movie IS certainly notable enough to have a set of subpages. You may not be familiar with Assault on Precinct 13, but it's a highly influential genre film that was enormously commercially and critically successful in Europe and later had a cult following in the US. Personally, I'm against merging and think the Street Thunder article should stay separate from the main movie article. 

Anyway, my problem with Dan100 is that he decided to arbitrarily &quot;jump the gun&quot; and merge the article without having taken any part in the discussion on that page. He just went ahead and merged it. There was absolutely no consensus on the talk page that the article should be merged. In fact, the last user convincingly argued that the article should be kept separate, and that seemed to be the end of the discussion.  Dan100 either didn't bother to read the discussion, or he arrogantly decided to ignore it. He has done this sort of thing at least twice before on other pages, he continues to do it despite being told by other users that it is not proper procedure (and rude), and he should receive some sort of warning from an admin.

Whenever I try to legitimately clean up the Quotes section, the bot reverts it back to a more poorly formatted version.
:Too much of the quotes look like vandalism to the bot. In fact, those episode pages are way to crufted up to the point that they just like childish and loaded with random trivia (trivia usually is avoided) and quotes. At any rate, you should edit other things and wait a bit, so that the very new user contrib log stops following you. Since the bot scans new users from this, you would be able to pass it. But I'd advise you to trim, preferable removing the quotes section unless the quotes are notable.'''[[User talk:Voice of All|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Voice&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;-of-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;All&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 05:39, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

Do you still have/are you willing to share the tool that produced those things? (Maybe I'm blind, but I can't seem to find any link to it anywhere...it didn't rely on the toolserver, did it?) I'm looking to produce a similar-in-spirit type of report for the 24 hours over which an FA is on the main page, broken down by % major edits, vandalism reversions, etc., and by % anon edits vs registered users. But I'd really rather not reinvent the wheel, and your reports seemed quite good at identifying major edits in particular, which is rather important to the quality of the results. Thanks!

If the former, I'm a bit confused, since % reverts should presumably max out around 50% (plausibly slightly over 50% due to not reverting far enough the first time).

== Question/Request ==

Okay, first, I just wanted to know if the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{message}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; button that comes up whenever I'm responding on a talk page is from your VoA script. 

If it is, can I make two requests:

*Can you add {{tl|vandalblock}} &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the list? That would really help me out when I'm blocking vandals at AIV.

*When I go to a userpage, is it possible to have a little button to {{tl|indefblock}} a user? That also would help out. 

Thanks, and sorry if I made a mistake in regards to your script.

==bot reverting legitimate edit to Caribbean Community==

Hello, I got a message saying that your bot had automatically reverted my recent edit to the [[Caribbean Community]] article. Now I appreciate that vandals and trolls tend to run wild at times on Wikipedia, however my edit was a very carefully referenced edit (all of it coming from newspaper articles). Could you please just have your bot revert the changes or at least allow me to reinstate the edit (which was an update to a section of the article)?

== Accountabillity ==

Thanks for your reply to my concerns.  I specifically mentioned holding admins accountable to the community as you said that you prefered not to submit desysopped admins to RfA which I think should be a near absolute requirement (other than emergency or temporary desysoppings during ungoing cases).  You also stated that the beaurocrats promotional decisions are generally not reviewable by ArbCom which I think is the wrong tack to take given the breach of consensus in the Carnildo RfA.  I also think that claims of community consensus rather than that evidenced on a particular RfA or AfD are far too easily abused to do whatever the beaurocrat/admin wants rather than the will of the community and as such are simply unacceptable.  I don't mean to deny your contributions to the encyclopedia or tour general fitness to be an arbitrator, but we seem to have a disagreement in what I regard as a fundamental issue within wikipedia (people not feeling bound by demonstrated consensus) [[User:Eluchil404|Eluchil404]] 05:52, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

Howdy!

Regarding edits [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:86.29.129.187&amp;oldid=92551799 like this]... The [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Desertification&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=92551702 revert] was actually mine, so it looks a bit silly (and might also confuse the editor in question) if it reads &quot;was reverted by automated bot&quot; (I was still human last time I checked). ;-) Would it be difficult to make the bot make sure that '''it''' did the actual revert and warn only if it did?

== Freakazoid! ==

Looks like it took less than 2 days for the vandals to hit [[Freakazoid!]] again.

Thanks for unprotecting ''[[Freakazoid!]]''; while I agree that, after a while, articles should be unprotected, I've attempted to do that in the past with the article, only to have it immediately vandalized again. As it is, I've already had to perform one rollback on the article.

Hai,

I've recently created an article about Tapak Suci. It's an indonesian martial arts style.
I've added a picture and some reference sites.
The problem is it identified one of the site as spam. It's the www.welcome.to/tapaksuci_sg link.
Because of this al my editting are gone including the picture I put in. Een though the site is vital for the article.
I find this an error of the bot that reverted my edittings. Could you please retrieve the written data.  The www.welcome.to website can be deleated which then I will apply for the white list.

Sincerely
Anthony

The Decider has some interesting things to say at [[Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2006/Vote#Expansion]], including &quot;Anyone who has recently withdrawn ... might reconsider.&quot;

I am new to this place, and decided to use ArbCom elections as a quick and furious tutorial in what happens behind the scenes. I read and read and read, and came December 4, was immediately ready to cast a few votes. Later in the day I cast a second batch, including in support of your candidacy. Your statement was good, and your answers were modest and practical. 

I read the &quot;oppose&quot; comments. Some of them make sense. Perhaps you are extremely moderate and deliberate. But so what? You were running to be part of ArbCom, not to be the whole committee by yourself.

In the end, running is a service to the community; and for most of the candidates, it is repaid poorly: no seat, and odd bits of complaint and abuse. All the same, it is a true service, to broaden the choices for editors, to raise ideas in distinctive ways.

If you return, I cannot promise you a successful campaign. But I can promise you my thanks.  [[User:Jd2718|Jd2718]] 22:53, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;Decline of Buddhism in India&quot; Article ==

Hello.
I recently reverted the article 'Decline of Buddhism in India&quot; due to the baised taste of the article. It gave negative impressions of Hindus and Hinduism. It tried to make it appear to everyone that Hindus and their traditions were responsible for the decline of Buddhism. I added referenced material but vandals keep trying to hide my contributions. This has happened a numerous amount of times.
Please allow me to further revert the material.

Thanks!!:) &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/136.159.209.121|136.159.209.121]] ([[User talk:136.159.209.121|talk]]) 02:28, 11 December 2006 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

== Advice? ==

I wanted to ask the advice of someone who would probably know and [[User:MarkS]] had recommended that I ask you.

I just recently installed my own MediaWiki and I've been in the process of setting it up. I would very much like the extra functionality of the extra edit buttons (the MediaWiki software only installs the first 11, leaving out many of the others) and after hours of looking around and banging my head, I was extremely relieved to find [[User:MarkS]]'s page, which is why I initially contacted him.

I wanted to ask two questions if I may, though. How would I change this so that it would be Wiki wide (in the case of my own private Wiki) rather than through my User-page? Do you know what I would need to do in order to have the extra edit buttons available for all edit pages on a personal wiki and how one would go about doing this?

I also thought I would ask, as you might know: standard MediaWiki doesn't have the 'special character box' available for the edit page. Unfortunately a lot of the work I do is in linguistics and so having the special characters is essential to me. All of the information I have found at either Meta or through MediaWiki-L has been conflicting or old and not useful. Would you have any suggestions as to how to go about adding this?

Thanks again, your response is much appreciate!

Best wishes,

Chris

Hi. Sorry--wasn't vandalizing the article, just trying to clearf up a misstake I made. Do i get points takin off? Sincerely yours, Lt. Kiji.

== Question  ==

I'm new to wikipedia and decided to edit my school's stub (Westerville Central High School (Ohio)).  It was reverted by a bot.  I was just curious as to why my writing was considered vandalism.

Thanks, [[User:Minkus2816|Minkus2816]] 05:33, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

== Protection requests, protected pages ==

Couple of things.
#I'd really like to de-clutter WP:RFPP [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;action=edit], namely remove the long lines of hashes and large commented out sections, so it looks something like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Steel359/Sandbox&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=96144732 this]. This will require co-operation from your bot.
#Your bot is not listing all the protected pages on [[WP:PP]]. Taking the top three on [[CAT:SEMI]] as examples (currently [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]], [[1989]] and [[2007 in television]]), only one is present on the protected pages list. This is making WP:PP pretty useless.

== Protecting articles ==

Hey, I've had some problems with the VoA script. When I'm editing an article and I click semi-protect, the window that opens is really, really small, and it takes me a while to manually scroll down and protect the page. Is it just me, or is that some problem? And do you know of a solution? Btw, you told me a while ago on AIM to remind you about some things I suggested. So, I'll tell you them again. For user pages, can you add a button that automatically inserts {{tl|indefblock}} and adds a edit summary of &quot;User blocked indefinitely.&quot; Another thing I would like is you could add a button for {{tl|vandalblock}} on the user talk page. That would really be helpful. Thanks for everything, VoA!

== My recent change ==

Hy, Voice of All. &lt;br&gt;
I'm referring to you here, because I don't want you to loose your precious time searching on various talk pages/articles &quot;what somebody did&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
I've made a bigger revert (with few ...bigger... paragraphs removed, but planning to restore them in proper way) on the article Pagania.&lt;br&gt;
I've tried to stay away from arguing on that article. I don't want to make edit wars with tens of reverts in few hours.&lt;br&gt;
So I leaved the things to go their own way for a few months... and when I've returned, I see a litter of flees, instead seeing seriously formed NPOV article.&lt;br&gt;
I know that removing big sections (or doing any major changes) without consulting on talk page is considered as a kind of vandalism. &lt;br&gt;
Still, I couldn't allow blatant expansionist propaganda with &quot;filtered&quot; and &quot;channelized&quot; data. &lt;br&gt;
I can't find you the proper words to describe the Greaterserbian assertions inserted in that article. The content of the article was greaterserbian textual orgy (see this change [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pagania&amp;oldid=55247491] &quot;most western Serbian borderland&quot; ), an example of exuberance of greediness and wantonness (though the latter word isn't good to reflect the Croatian word ''obijest'', which is the best to describe this case; this word is often used to describe the behaviour of spoiled brat). &lt;br&gt;
I'd react earlier, but, as I've said on the talk page, I have a life. I can't &quot;cover&quot; hundred articles, spending my time in arguing with a bunch of persons hiding  behind one or two nicks (or with persons that don't have normal social life). &lt;br&gt;
I'm not asking you to side with me, neither I want to involve you into this. I'm just trying to explain you the reasons of my recent action, and to draw your attention on some other users' perfid behaviour. [[User:Kubura|Kubura]] 20:40, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

Hi. I'm a little concerned over your Bot's automatic revert of Youtube links. Can you please disable this, as this is explicitly ''not'' the intent of [[WP:EL]] guidelines on the issue.

Could you have your bot watch this page for edits made by [[User:Leyasu]] through IPs?  It has been semi-protected again after Leyasu evaded his ban again and revert warred with several users.

== My Bot ==

Hi, I am Harishankar, I am working on creating a bot for AntiVandalism which you have denied for approval. And the reasons which you have should be really clear and correct. But as a software developer and a RC patrol myself, I am very much interested in developing a bot. Can you please give me some hints or new idea to develop a new unique bot?

==Problem with moving articles==
Hi, I tried to move [[Gay+prague]] (a poorly titled article created by a new user) to [[Gay life in Prague]] (a better title) twice, but the bot reverted it. Probably because &quot;gay&quot; is such a common insult among your garden-variety vandal. Can you fix this for me? Thanks [[User:GhostPirate|GhostPirate]] 22:09, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

==A request for assistance==
Would you support the concept of moving the Earhart &quot;myths&quot; to a separate page or article? The reason for my suggesting this is that the main article should be an accurate and scholarly work while the speculation and conspiracy theories surrounding the disappearance of Amelia Earhart are interesting, they belong in a unique section. Most researchers, as you know, discount the many theories and speculation that has arisen in the years following her last flight. Go onto the Earhart discussion page and register your vote/comments...and a Happy New Year to you as well. [[User:Bzuk|Bzuk]] 05:02 3 January 2007 (UTC).

== Bot Request ==

Thank you for giving your view on my request for bot approval. The bot, reverts vandalism on all user and user talk page (Including blocked users who abuse it themselves) It also detects page move vandalism (Which anti-vandal bot can't do) and innapropriate username vandalism. I wanted it to block inapropriate usernames, but I don't think that's going to happen. But, it only reverts swearwords that newly appear with edits on userpages, if a swearword exsists on the page and it is over one hour old, it is ignored. (that's how it avoids continually editing the pages on the words)--[[User:Rasillon|Rasillon]] 17:12, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

== Suggestion for the bot ==

Here's an interesting situation involving VA Bot II. I just reverted a page blanking to [[Batman]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Batman&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98906249]. I then left a warning on the user's talk page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A207.14.163.209&amp;diff=98906452&amp;oldid=98906451]. However at the same time as I was writing my warning, VA Bot II also added a warning for the same edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A207.14.163.209&amp;diff=98906451&amp;oldid=80697595] even though it had not reverted the edit. As a result the user ended up with two warnings on their talk page for the same incident. I assume that VA Bot tried to remove the same vandalism to the Batman article that I did but I &quot;beat it to the punch&quot;. While two warnings are not the end of the world, it would be good to avoid if possible. Perhaps VA Bot should check to see if its revert succeeded before leaving the message?

== Unprotecting [[Thalía]] ==

Hope it works but doubt it. I am the user who nominated it for semi-protection. The edit wars are almost non-existant but new registered users have popped up now who are trying to do the same BS edits previously done to this page and [[Paulina Rubio]]. Today alone I had to revert one new user twice today on Thalía. It was nice while it lasted. . .   [[User:Ronbo76|Ronbo76]] 01:59, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
:The edit wars have begun anew on [[Thalía]]. Usually the edits start as wars on album sales and then denigrate to vandalism. One editor boosted her album sales by a huge amount followed by another edit. There have been a number of edits by anonymous IPs which usually touch up or torch the war. Could you please take a look and advise by an edit or two? Thanks, [[User:Ronbo76|Ronbo76]] 17:49, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

::Despite notices on the talkpages on both this article and [[Paulina Rubio]]'s articles, the vandals are back. As just a regular user, I cannot adequately protect this articles from all the edits. Fortunately some other editors have stepped up, but the anon IPs are getting the bold. Please see Paulina's edit tonight where an anon IP reversed the editor who questioned fair use. I respect what you do, but believe semi-protection is still needed. Thanks, [[User:Ronbo76|Ronbo76]] 08:18, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

== VoABot ==

Hi, I've gone through VoABot's most recent changes to [[WP:PP/U]] and it seems to be duplicating ''everything'' it's adding several times, and possibly adding stuff that was there before, I'm not sure. You seem to have spotted it already and reverted back to Luna Santin's version, but it's still editing, and still doing the same thing. Would it perhaps be a good idea to &lt;s&gt;turn off the bot&lt;/s&gt; disable the bot on this page only until this is resolved? Thanks – [[User:Gurch|Gurch]] 14:57, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

== Dragonriders of Pern reversion ==

Hi, your bot reverted my additions to the Dragonriders of Pern page with the comment &quot;information&quot;. I looked up what that might mean and got: &quot;Information - The edit was identified as adding addresses, phone numbers, MySpace, Facebook, Geocities, or YouTube pages.&quot; However, I haven't added any addresses, numbers, or links to pages hosted at the sites listed above. What triggered the bot? [[User:Tameeria|tameeria]] 23:13, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

Ok, the notice I got on my talk page also mentioned blogs and forums, so I think it might have the forum link that triggered the bot. Now, I've got another question: The part that I edited already contained a forum link (to the PernMU* Discussion Forum) before my edit. So if forum links are not wanted, shouldn't that one go as well? Or was it previously approved? This is only my second edit on Wikipedia, so I'm not really comfortable with removing other people's links yet... [[User:Tameeria|tameeria]] 01:14, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

Hey, your bot incorrectly reverted an edit I made, saying it was vandalism. This can be found:

Hello, your bot detected a change into my page from a vandal quite effectivly (link to get the exact change and ip that have been detected [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEsurnir&amp;diff=100111142&amp;oldid=100097446]) Unfortunatly, the task of your bot was limmited to &quot;detect&quot; and warn the vandal, and it didn't reverted my page.

I first went to the talk page to issue the warning, saw that your bot issued a warning, then after a few moment your bot didn't reverted my page, so I had to revert it myself.

I don't know why this fighterjock didn't helped me this time :( (perhaps because I work hard to counter Antivandalbot plans for world domination) but I think you should know about that -- [[User:Esurnir|Esurnir]]

==Protection of [[Dhammakaya Movement]] and [[Wat Phra Dhammakaya]] ==
Hi. Regarding your removal of protection from these two articles on 10 January 2007, I just want to let you know that the articles are being attacked again. These deleters had been extremely persistent in the past as you can see in the history. I and many other editors spent so much time reverting the articles, just to have them vandalized again in just hours (or even minutes). Courtless warnings were given out, and the anonymous deleters completely ignored the attempts to communicate. Can you please put the protection back to both articles? I'm sure it will be appreciated by many people. Regards. --[[User:Melanochromis|Melanochromis]] 06:08, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

Can you tell me how I can get a page protected? Or request it, anyway? -[[User:Freekee|Freekee]] 06:13, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
The reason I ask is that [[The Great Dalmuti]] is being vandalized again. It used to be Sprotected, but you removed that. In the edit summary, you said &quot;Time.&quot; does that mean the protection had a time limit? The page has been edited many times over the past 12 months by some high-fiving kids from San Jose State. One of them had an account that was banned, but we can't ban the IPs from the school. We've reverted three edits in one day, since they started up again. It would be really nice if we could have it protected again. -[[User:Freekee|Freekee]] 06:18, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

Hi, thanks for your bot. It is helping in automatically reverting pov by some users. I had been working hard not to hurt them(as they are new to wikiepdia and take time to settle) and also at the same time in removing pov and adhering to [[WP:INCITIES]] style for some time. AFAIK, there are three users and one common ip so far and I also am not sure whether it is same user. I am thinking of waiting for some more time before submitting for some dispute resolution.

== [[         (      )]] club un-semiprotection ==

You removed semiprotection from the [[NUFC|Newcastle]] and [[SAFC|Sunderland]] club articles yesterday; I can see how it makes Wikipedia more open, but [[Newcastle United F.C.]] has been vandalised by unregistered users again a few times since it was unprotected, and I'd request you change the page back to being semiprotected - the same goes for [[Manchester United F.C.]], which is also a frequent target. [[Sunderland A.F.C.]] has been OK so far. &lt;br&gt;
I think slightly different rules apply for         -team pages to, say, pages about current controversial news events, because          rivalry is always there (perhaps less so outside the football season); it's petty, I guess it's usually just kids on their school computers, but it'd still be prevented better with semiprotection.

I just re-semi-protected [[World Social Forum]].  I notice that you recently unprotected it to see if the spamming would continue, but as before when I unprotected it, the      spamming started right back up.  It appears to be a spambot exploiting open proxies.  The addresses being spammed change, so blacklisting is not an useful option either.  So I don't see any better choice but to semiprotect again.  If you have any objections to my actions or other suggestions on how to handle it, please let me know.  --[[User:Edgar181|Ed]] ([[User talk:Edgar181|Edgar181]]) 15:45, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

You would please look at the article about [[James Cameron]]? I started the article, because the previous one was plarigized from Dr. Cameron's website about his museum. I think some one from the museum is now trying to plarigize the article. I am not sure I want to restart the article, if it would be deleted again.

== Thanks for the support on RfA! ==

With the RfA complete and over, and a day to recover on top, I finally feel able to click a few buttons and write a few comments. Of those, there's about a dozen editors I hadn't come across before, whom I particularly want to write a comment to. 

The areas we co-worked on seem ages ago now. I hope the years have treated you well since then. :) As you'll notice, I adopted one of your scripts a while back :) It helps a lot.

As a new user of admin access, I might well benefit from guidance for a while to come. I trust my existing approach overall, but its an area one doesn't really want to make even a single mistake, and where the judge is the eyes of ones peers. So advice at times would be a [[Good Thing]]. 

To start that off, I've set up a subpage to post questions when I need to check &quot;what would other users do here?&quot;. I'll probably have a lot of those early on. If you feel able to watchlist [[User:FT2/Advice sought]], I'd really appreciate it :) a consultative page is my first step in ensuring this new access will be taken responsibly when circumstances arise. 

Another area I'll use it for is queries on features such as scripting or templates, where I'm probably under-efficient in editing, due to unhelpfully limited knowledge. I get the impression that's an area you're quite active with :) Which is good!

Separate from all that, I look forward to seeing you round. What subject areas are you working on these days? 

Keep in touch, happy editing in 2007, and once again - many thanks! :) [[user:FT2|FT2]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;([[User_talk:FT2|Talk]] | [[Special:Emailuser/FT2|email]])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 02:32, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== Vandalism and block ==

Hi Voice,

Regarding the current flag on the article for [[Tin Pot Operation]] 

The article has been accepted during discussion, as being valid for inclusion because the band is listed on The Centre for Political Song at Glasgow Caledonian University.  The wiki entry allows the user to find more information.  It has been deliberately kept brief and factual, and without hyperbole.

The most recent edit was to revert vandalism, which has already been flagged, a quick look at the site history will show this.

I hope this is sufficient to allow the article to remain.

Many thanks

Someone at Wikipedia recently flagged this article for revision since it had parts that made it read as if it were a student essay rather than a biography.

You need to put the protection back on the [[Bermuda Triangle]] page.

At least for the last two days, I've chasing vandals, first one, then at the rate of at least two.

==What do we have to do to get [[Rafida]] on long-term semi-protection status?==

What do we have to do to get [[Rafida]] on long-term semi-protection status, considering that the article has been persistently attacked by a user who freely resorts to vandalism when we refuse to accept his gibberish edits, for almost a year now?  Asking on [[WP:RFP]] seems to be worse than useless unless the article is directly in the middle of a high-volume attack (which is not the problem on [[Rafida]]).  You recently un-semi-protected [[Rafida]], the long-term vandal added his gibberish to the article again, I reverted his gibberish again, and now the user will likely stalk along behind me and revert as many of my two-week-old edits that he can find which have not yet been modified by other users -- as he has already done about four or five times in the past.  And of course, I'll have to clean up the resulting mess largely on my own, without much help from administrators, as has also been the pattern in the past.  How many of these cycles do we have to go through before [[Rafida]] is placed on long-term semi-protection status???

Of course the vandal struck at [[Rafida]] again, and of course he also stalked around after me, vandalistically reverting my edits again (just as I predicted above over a day ago), and of course I had to clean things up myself without any help from admins again.

== having issues with VoABot II  ==

Hello,

I recently had the following message:
Your recent edit to August Ritter (diff) was reverted by automated bot. The edit was identified as adding either vandalism, link spam, or test edits to the page. If you want to experiment, please use the sandbox. If this revert was in error, please contact the bot operator. Thanks! // VoABot II 20:33, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

The article about &quot;August Ritter&quot; has repeatedly been redirected to &quot;Bill Ritter (politician)&quot;, and attempts made to clear this by various users who, like me, presumably thought that a blank page was better than an incorrect link.  Presumably there is some way to kill the page altogether so it ends up unlinked again, but being a noob I don't know how.  Clearly just blanking the page arouses the attention of VoABot II.  Perhaps the bot could be programmed to allow blanking of pages that are simply redirects?

Other than that, the concept of an auto-vandal-catching bot sounds fantastic - keep up the good work.

== Admin JS Request ==

We've been having some difficulty recently with vandals mass-creating articles outside of mainspace (see {{vandal|Tryerlop}} and {{vandal|NoobStr}} for examples). Your admin JS includes the ability to mass delete test or vandalism pages in mainspace, but does not allow us to delete other namespaces (see the link atop [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Newpages?username=NoobStr&amp;limit=100 this page]). Would it be possible to do something to allow those types of deletion, or is that beyond the scope of what you want to do?

Hi, i've been using your RC patrol tools for some time and they've been quite useful. But after you made changes to it recently, the &quot;Revert&quot; options no longer show up in Opera. I checked, and they work fine on Firefox and IE. Any way you could fix them so they sork on Opera again? Thanks. --[[User:snowolfd4|&lt;font color=&quot;#9696A0&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;'''snowolf'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0A0096&quot; face=&quot;tahoma&quot;&gt;'''D4'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;( &lt;font color=&quot;#339966&quot; face=&quot;Constantia&quot;&gt;[[User_Talk:Snowolfd4| '''talk''']]&lt;/font&gt; / &lt;font color=&quot;#CC0099&quot; face=&quot;Constantia&quot;&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4| '''@''']]&lt;/font&gt; )&lt;/sup&gt; 16:24, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

== RC Script template changes ==

A quick query. I use your non-admin RC script which is excellent but I was wondering how I could update the warning templates in the top tabs to [[WP:UTM|the new ones]]. I feel I should use the new ones but obviously it's much easier to just click a button instead of keeping the table open: I never can remember all the different template names! Thankyou for your help, and a great tool and sorry if I've missed this elsewhere. --[[User:Farosdaughter|Farosdaughter]] 16:54, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

== Disabling popups by default in your monobook ==

Hi, VOA. First off, thanks a million for the blood, sweat and tears that you put into those custom js and css and sharing them with everyone. I was wondering if you'd tell me (a total code ignoramus) how I could disable popups by default? I keep selecting the &quot;disable popups&quot; function on the popups when they appear, and although they go away on that page, every time a new page is loaded they come right back.

I wanted to know if you knew how to add additional &quot;warning scripts&quot; to the tabs.

== Error with your bot ==

Hi, take a look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Empire_Earth:_The_Art_of_Conquest&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=109291862 this] edit your bot made. If you see the edit summary, you will notice that it mentions the wrong username, {{user|Cydebot}} instead of {{user|Empire Earth DUDE!!}}, as well as including some HTML that probably shouldn't be there. It might be worth mentioning that Cydebot is the author of the revision the bot reverts to. The bot then proceeds to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cydebot&amp;curid=4700132&amp;diff=109291883&amp;oldid=108517963 warn] Cydebot instead of the user who actually made the edit.

==Automated message to bot owners==
As a result of discussion on the village pump and mailing list, bots are now allowed to edit up to 15 times per minute.  The following is the new text regarding bot edit rates from [[Wikipedia:Bot Policy]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Until new bots are accepted they should wait 30-60 seconds between edits, so as to not clog the recent changes list and user watchlists. After being accepted and a [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrat]] has marked them as a bot, they can edit at a much faster pace. Bots doing non-urgent tasks should edit approximately once every ten seconds, while bots who would benefit from faster editing may edit approximately once every every four seconds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Also, to eliminate the need to spam the bot talk pages, please add [[Wikipedia:Bot owners' noticeboard]] to your watchlist.  Future messages which affect bot owners will be posted there.  Thank you.  --[[User:Mets501|Mets501]] 05:14, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

==Dispute at [[Copa del Rey]] and [[Athletic Bilbao]]==
There is on-going dispute regarding how many Copa del Reys Athletic Bilbao should be credited with. It centres on the 1902 Copa. I would appreciate your input/mediation. I have posted the message below to try explain why Athletic should be credited with the 1902 Copa.   

I am not disputing that ''Club Vizcaya'' won the Copa in 1902. However this team is part of [[Athletic Bilbao]] history. ''Club Vizcaya'' is not a separate club from Athletic, but is part of the clubs history. Several clubs including [[FC Barcelona]], [[Real Madrid]], [[Real Sociedad]] and [[RCD Espanyol]] and [[Real Union]] have won the [[Copa del Rey]] under different names. All trophies won under their various names are included in one list. So why should the Athletic record be different ?

Below is a timeline which explains the early history of Athletic. 
*Early 1890s: ''Bilbao FC'' formed by British workers.
*1898: Basque students returning from UK form ''Athletic Club''.
*1902: Above two teams enter combined team known as ''Club Vizcaya'' in Copa del Rey.
*1903: These two teams merge and form ''Athletic Club Bilbao''
*1907: The ''Club Vizcaya''  name is revived as ''Athletic Club de Bilbao''  and  ''Union Vizcaino'' entered another combined team in the Copa del Rey.

The 1902 Copa is included in Athletic’s own honours list [http://www.athletic-club.net/acc/home.asp?a=7&amp;b=2&amp;idi=2] and the trophy is in their museum [http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/spancup1902.html]. The eleven ''Club Vizcaya''    players who played in the final - L. Arana, E Careaga, P. Larranga, L. Silva, A. Arana, Goiri, Cazeaux, Astorquia, W. Dyer, R. Silva, W. Evans - are all included in an archive of former Athletic players [http://www.athletic-club.net/acc/home.asp?a=7&amp;b=4&amp;ini=A&amp;idi=2].

Photo (c) Nancy J Price. June 2005 in Tempe, Arizona.&quot; I also licensed it appropriately (I thought).
  	+

== FeTNA lead page ==

Dear Editor,
I want to let you know about the inaccuracies in the lead page about FeTNA.I tried to edit it.As I am new to wiki I may not have followed the proper procedures.
The lead page and the past discussions are there but there seems to be no change in the lead page.
I would like to look at my edit and please get back to me.
Are you one of the editors or how is this process being carried out.
I appreciate your getting back to me.

== Your bot reverted my changes ==

I am a new user and I tried editing my first article.  After my submission of a new section your bot reverted my changes.  I am a noob to editing wikipedia and I don't really understand what was wrong with my edit.  Your bot's message said that I am using a shared IP or that I am adding free-hosting links to a website.  Could you please help me understand what I did wrong and look at my edit if you can.  Thank you.

Please note that I am re-posting this question since you have not yet responded but seem to be responding to other questions.  I don't mean to be rude, but I myself find it rude that Wikipedia says that questions can be asked on discussion and talk pages and yet no one is taking the time to respond or at least say why they are not responding if my question is not very good.  I do not want to fill a pages history with a mess of changes being reverted by your bot due to trial and error, but if no one tells me what I am doing wrong, that is exactly what I am going to have to do until I can figure out what it is I am doing wrong.  Again, I am not trying to be rude or disrespectful.  I am just new here and trying to get some help. [[User:Robear128|Robear]] 16:06, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

== Request edit of protected RFC/Essjay ==

You protected the {{rfcuser|Essjay}} just as I was trying to save a typo correction to my endorsement (the last, #14) of [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Essjay#Outside view by Tariqabjotu|Tariqabjotu's outside view, #3.32 in the TOC]]. Could that correction still be made? If the page is saved instead of deleted, I'd hate to have my typo set in stone. It's one dratted apostrophe missing near the start, setting the italics wrong through the rest of the paragraph:&lt;br /&gt;{{space|10}}'''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;(UTC)]&amp;lt;/span&gt;: '&quot;&amp;lt;u&gt;From the moment&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;'''&lt;br /&gt;should be:&lt;br /&gt;{{space|10}}'''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;(UTC)]&amp;lt;/span&gt;: ''&quot;&amp;lt;u&gt;From the moment&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;'''&lt;br /&gt;Just a doubled apostrophe to start the italics off right, that's all I need.

I noticed you deleted [[:Category:AfD debates (Nominator unsure of category)]], though I'm not sure if it was the result of a CfD or some other change to the process.

Also, [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion]] still has a link to the category.

== WikiProject category deletions ==
Hi! I was trying to get [[WP:CPS|WikiProject Carnivorous plants]]'s assessment set up and noticed two of the categories I created were deleted by you, such as [[:Category:Disambiguation carnivorous plant pages]] and [[:Category:FA-class carnivorous plant articles]]. (I haven't checked the assessment categories for [[WP:PLANTS]] yet, but I assume they were deleted, too, since it's taking longer than expected for bot approval to tag appropriate pages). I understand the policy of deleting categories with no content. But in the initial phases of setting up the assessment, is there a way to tag the wikiproject categories so they won't be deleted? What's the policy on this? Should I create the categories when we have a need for them? I just assumed I should create them first and then set up the assessment per the guidelines at [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Using the bot]]. I'll wait for your thoughts on this before I recreate it (Our wikiproject should have an FA article soon enough, so the one category will definitely be needed). Thanks! --[[User:Rkitko|Rkitko]] 07:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, I'd like to know where these deletions were discussed as well.  The categories used by the [[WP:1.0/I|assessment system]] are automatically generated from tags and are necessary for the tracking bots to run correctly; deleting them was a profoundly bad idea, as articles tend to appear in them quite unpredictably. [[User:Kirill Lokshin|Kirill Lokshin]] 21:53, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

I seem to have missed the CFD on this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Category:Shared_templates_used_only_on_Wikimedia_Commons one], moreover, I was in the middle of related categorising and had this one open and editing... and the system gave me a message it had been deleted after I started the edit... which makes sense, that was at least twelve hours back. So what's the scoop? This one hasn't had the autotagging logic installed yet in {{tl|interwikitmp-grp}} and {{Tl|commonstmp}}, so I'd suppose it had no contents... YET.

== Auto Revert from Bot in error ==

My username is jrhjr; I noticed several errors on the entry for Kerrville, Texas.  I am a native of Kerrville and have written a newspaper column about local history for over a dozen years.

The first, most glaring error was that our community was named for Major James Kerr ''a veteran of the Confederate Army''.  Kerr died before the Civil War.  He was a veteran of the Texas Revolution.

Other changes also needed to be made, but these were reverted by the bot.

Rather frustrating!  This is supposed to be a wiki, where users can provide content.

This is in line with all of the other category entries for counties of England.

'''Samuel Griffith''' (February 14, 1816 – October 1, 1893) was a [[Wales|Welsh]]-American political figure who represented [[Pennsylvania's 20th congressional district]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from March 4, 1871 to March 3, 1873.

==Biography==
Griffith's birthplace in Wales, [[Merthyr Tydfil]], was a booming industrial town which, at the time, was a part of the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Glamorgan]].  He was instructed in elementary subjects by a private teacher and subsequently graduated from [[Allegheny College]] in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].  Following law studies, he was admitted to the bar in 1846, at the age of thirty and, over the following decades, practiced law in the [[Mercer County, Pennsylvania|Mercer County]] seat, [[Mercer, Pennsylvania|Mercer]].

At the age of fifty-six, he campaigned as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to represent his congressional district and was elected to the [[42nd United States Congress]] in November 1870.  After an unsuccessful [[United States House election, 1872|reelection campaign in 1872]], he resumed law practice in Mercer.

Samuel Griffith died in Mercer at the age of seventy-seven and was buried in Mercer Cemetery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Foyle Cup''' is a youth soccer tournament held every year in [[Derry|Derry City]], [[County Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. Along with the [[Milk Cup]], which takes place around the same time, The Foyle Cup is one of Ireland and indeed Europe's premier youth tournaments.

==History==
The competition began in 1992 with only eight teams competing. It is seen as one of the most important and pivotal tournaments in [[Northern Ireland]], as it presents an opportunity for the youth of Northern Ireland to show their abilities. Academy teams of such European clubs as [[Werder Bremen]], [[IFK Göteborg]] and [[Ferencvaros]] have participated in the tournament, along with teams from the U.S. and Canada in recent times. It is widely recognised as a tournament that launches the careers of young players aspiring to sign professional contracts.In 2003 former [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] player and current [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] chairman, [[Niall Quinn]] launched the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derrycity.gov.uk/Press%20Releases/190503-foylecup.htm Niall Quinn Launches 2003 Foyle Cup] retrieved 15 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 competition was launched by [[Lawrie Sanchez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ulster.ac.uk/releases/2006/2245.html Foyle Cup launched by Sanchez] retrieved 15 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, Foyle Cup chairman, Michael Hutton confirmed that the 2007 competition will feature special guest, [[Liverpool F.C.]] legend [[Phil Neal]]. The competition has been [[title sponsor]]ed by local businesses such as [[Football special]] cola and Hughes insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dubliners sink QPR to reach final stages |date=23 July 2011  |subscription=yes |work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |accessdate=21 December 2016 |url=https://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;u=wikipedia&amp;v=2.1&amp;id=GALE%7CA262117425&amp;it=r&amp;asid=5ee55a55a5ce276fc71a1be14e32472b |via=[[InfoTrac Newsstand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celtic target treble as Foyle Cup goes from strength to strength |work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |date=15 June 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2016 |subscription=yes |via=[[InfoTrac Newsstand]] |url=https://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;u=wikipedia&amp;v=2.1&amp;id=GALE%7CA258870638&amp;it=r&amp;asid=f38286841379e06ac734298e48e30e80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Foyle Cup 'a hughly successful tournament' |work=[[Derry Journal]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221155200/http://www.derryjournal.com/news/foyle-cup-a-hugely-successful-tournament-1-7494605 |date=26 July 2016 |archivedate=21 December 2016 |deadurl=no |url=http://www.derryjournal.com/news/foyle-cup-a-hugely-successful-tournament-1-7494605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Jake Pullis is a criminal whose aliases are numerous and full of creativity. He is known to those in Japan as Hikihiki Huuwali Chei (also known as: the great dragon almighty who hath brought us tacos.
He is recognized as a Robinhood like character- stealing from the rich and giving to the poor (aka himself). He often occupies himself with government work to avoid suspicion and is part of the Queen of England's secret service society. He IS a double 00 number and should not be messed with, and suspected of causing global warming. He also has ties with Santa Clause and the Easter Bunny. He is secretly 9,000,001 years old (which is proof as well that he must  have some connection with death). Although delightfully hilarious, he is also a dangerous beast. 
He was last spotted in the Sahara Desert by an unreliable source (aka a camel) whom he tried to milk. If you have any more information about this dangerous fiend or his whereabouts please feel free to add to the article.</text>

===[[Pregnant Ranma Problem]]===
This article is a discussion about something speculated in the fan community of Ranma 1/2.  Ranma was never pregnant or implied to be pregnant anywhere in the anime series or the manga so it is an irrelevant article.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- [[User:Mizushimo|Mizi]] 20:13, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as uncitable fancruft. Google search for &quot;pregnant ranma problem&quot; returns just the Wikipedia entry and various Wikipedia mirrors. [[User:NeoChaosX|NeoChaosX]] &lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[User talk:NeoChaosX|talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX|contribs]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 20:20, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  This isn't [[Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex]] (which was published by a notable author, [[Larry Niven]]).  [[User:ColourBurst|ColourBurst]] 20:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' fanfic nonsense that slipped through the cracks. [[User:Danny Lilithborne|Danny Lilithborne]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. The article was decent, only now it's accumulated a thick layer of cruft that direly needs to be wiped off. That said, I can't dispute the Google results. --[[User:Kizor|Kizor]] 21:31, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. If we cleaned off the fancruft we'd have an empty article. [[User:SVI|SVI]] 01:02, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Delete'''. Not really, it has a valid core of a plot element that makes intuitive but not actual sense. Anataeus here makes a good point, though. I'll get on it. --[[User:Kizor|Kizor]] 07:19, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Comment''':  I believe that it is verifiable (although I myself don't have the references) that Takahashi has been asked about what would happen if Ranma got pregnant and responded &quot;I don't think about that and neither should you.&quot;  That fact, I think, could usefully be noted somewhere in the other Ranma articles.  The rest of the article looks like straight original research/neologism to me. -- [[User:Antaeus Feldspar|Antaeus Feldspar]] 03:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*&lt;small&gt;'''Note''':  This debate has been included in the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Japan|list of Japan-related deletions]].  &lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;-- [[User:Qiszxo|Qiszxo]] 08:11, 31 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
*'''Delete''' because it's original research; however, the argument that it wasn't referenced in the manga/anime is really irrelevent to the topic at hand -- Ranma was until fairly recently far and away the anime with the strongest fanfiction presence on the web, and the pregnant issue came up a LOT. I have in fact heard of this outside WP, but I would agree it's not noteworthy or anything. People really ought to stop bashing everything little thing simply because they had never heard of it before. The Takahashi quote, I'm seen links to the interview with it before, for what it's worth. All said, the best thing to say is [[WP:NFT]]. [[User:Melodia|♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫]] 12:53, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' Melodia, I'm not basing my delete argument on not having heard it before, because I have heard it before.  I'm basing it on the fact that most fanfiction are not [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], and therefore cannot be used to support the article.  One quote from the author that says the topic is best left untouched seems to support the deletion.  [[User:ColourBurst|ColourBurst]] 19:21, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' to the article on the Ranma character, though not too much. [[User:FrozenPurpleCube|FrozenPurpleCube]] 16:37, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*&lt;small&gt;'''Note''':  This debate has been included in the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Anime and manga|list of Anime and manga-related deletions]] -&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User:Mizushimo|Mizi]] 19:44, 31 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
*After some time to more fully examine the article, my official belief on what should be done:  '''source''' the Takahashi quote and include it in one of the other Ranma 1/2 articles; '''delete''' all the rest as original research/neologism. -- [[User:Antaeus Feldspar|Antaeus Feldspar]] 21:51, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' verifiable facts to a Ranma 1/2 article (and '''delete''' the rest) per Antaeus Feldspar.  The question seems to be a genuinely common one in Ranma fandom, but the term itself does not seem to be common in the anime community even for this specific question.  (If no source can easily be found for the Takahashi quote, merge to a suitable talk page instead to allow fans to perform further research.)  &amp;mdash; [[User:Haeleth|Haeleth]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Haeleth|Talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 08:47, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' per the previous two editors, if the question is common enough within the fandom to have merited a quote from the author, but not common elsewhere. The question is raised with other gender-changing fiction, but the term is not used universally. [[User:AlmostReadytoFly|AlmostReadytoFly]] 00:57, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Unsourced. [[User:Interrobamf|Interrobamf]] 03:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

== POV Tag ==

I'm doing POV tag cleanup. Whenever an POV tag is placed, it is necessary to also post a message in the discussion section stating clearly why it is thought the article does not comply with POV guidelines, and suggestions for how to improve it. This permits discussion and consensus among editors. This is a drive-by tag, which is discouraged in WP, and it shall be removed. Future tags should have discussion posted as to why the tag was placed, and how the topic might be improved. Better yet, edit the topic yourself with the improvements. This statement is not a judgement of content, it is only a cleanup of frivolously and/or arbitrarily placed tags. No discussion, no tag.[[User:Jjdon|Jjdon]] ([[User talk:Jjdon|talk]]) 17:56, 26 April 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Looking at the literature, this seems a bit arcane to the point of non-notability and, of the few who have studied this, most don't use the term &quot;Decimal sequences.&quot; [[User:Calbaer|Calbaer]] 20:13, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Furthermore, any claimed applications to crypto are completely bogus. The author has no cryptographic credentials. The constuctions in his paper hark back to the era of simpleminded heuristics used in the days before Shannon. Notice that he publishes in the EE community, where people don't neccessarily know any better.  

::I would not say these claims are all completely bogus, nor that Kak is entirely without &quot;cryptographic credentials&quot;.  However, it does seem that any such claims require a heavy dose of skepticism.  For example see the recent usenet thread &quot;Base-b digits of primes and their reciprocals&quot; in sci.math, concerning apparently bogus claims he made in a Cryptologia article. It's amazing to me that apparently no one at Cryptologia caught that. --[[User:R.e.s.|r.e.s.]] 22:12, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

:[[Fractal cryptography]] was another such misguided attempt at do-it-yourself crypto by an amateur, albeit an academic. That article was AfD'd and deleted, and I think this one should too. [[User:Arvindn|Arvindn]] 00:13, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

:I think the key is this: &quot;so long as we mention that some content may come from Apache's original documentation.&quot; The original submitter didn't bother to do that. It *is* a copyvio if it doesn't comply with the license. I actually don't see any copyright or licensing information at all on the page from which the content was copied. I guess what we need is this: (1) If the page from which the content was copied is under the Apache license, we need someone to find where it says that. (2) We then need to comply with the license, which we aren't currently doing. --[[User:24.52.254.62|24.52.254.62]] 00:03, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

Balz has served as National Editor, Political Editor, White House correspondent and as the ''Washington Post''{{'}}s [[Texas]]-based Southwest correspondent. Balz sometimes appears on the news show ''[[Meet the Press]]'' and frequently appears on the PBS program ''[[Washington Week]]''. In April 2011 the [[White House Correspondents' Association]] honored Balz with the prestigious Merriman Smith Award for excellence in presidential coverage under deadline pressure.

==Fair use rationale for Image:ShiningVictory.jpg==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:ShiningVictory.jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:ShiningVictory.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;

==Adding new category to template==

After considering a sugestion made by an anon, I suggest a ''Major Adversaries'' section to be added. Since Saffron, Ryu Kumon and Herb don't fit in other categories, that new section which would allow those characters to be in the template.[[User:Facer|Facer]] 20:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:Also should consider Tsubasa in here somewhere. [[User:Derekloffin|Derekloffin]] 20:41, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
I've given this an edit attempt (mostly because I'm sick of not having links to numerous character pages in obvious places).  I'm not overly pleased with my look though, and categorizing some is no doubt disputable (is Mariko a major adversary for instance). [[User:Derekloffin|Derekloffin]] 00:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
:Lol, you beat me to adding the major adversaries section to the template (I was waiting for the 4 weeks period mentioned in the wikirules), but it's all cool. By the way, Mariko ''is'' a major adversary, but I'll add a comment on that here later tonight (I'm at the office right now). Good job anyway.[[User:Facer|Facer]] 20:22, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

== Major adversaries==

Going by the manga, I believe a character should be considered a major adversary if he/she:
*Appears only once.
*Helps to move the overall story forward.
*Has an entire story-arc devoted to him/her.
*Is more powerful than the members of the regular cast or those involved in the story.

I think it’s obvious why Pantyhose Taro belongs here, even if he appeared more than once in the manga.

Herb and Saffron are also obvious.

Mariko is not only the strongest female opponent Ranma has to defeat using only his girl form, and her story-arc helped move the overall story a little, by accidentally forcing Ranma to declare her love for Akane in front of the whole school (in the anime, this was also the story-arc where Ranma’s curse is revealed to all the school.)

I really don’t think that Ryu Kumon is really more powerful than Ranma, Ryoga and Mousse (but I admit he’s a cool character), however, his fighting style gives him a great advantage, and his story-arc helped bring Ranma closer to Nodoka, so he qualifies as a major adversary.

Rouge should be here as well, she has a full story-arc devoted to herself and her cursed form is more powerful than the regular cast.[[User:Facer|Facer]] 03:54, 11 November 2006 (UTC)


== Edit wars ==

Lately, the template has been on the verge of falling on an [[Wikipedia:Edit war|edit war]] due to constant editing by anons, particularly of the major adversaries section, so I had to protect it until an agreement of its contents is achieved, if that annoys some of you, I truly apologize for the inconvenience.

Above, I posted a series of characteristics major adversaries have according to the way they were presented in the manga which I believe helped to define why they were placed in that category. Going by that, it's clear that neither Ryoga nor Happosai fall into that place. While I admit the two of them are Ranma's biggest rivals, they are also important recurring characters who have appeared in a few story arcs helping Ranma in one way or the other. The major adversaries such as Mariko, Herb or Saffron appear once and don't have friendly ties with the cast.

Pantyhose Taro and Rouge are slightly different, but should also fall into the major adversaries category. While Taro appears more than once, his monster form is more powerful (at least at first) than the rest of the regular cast, he is not friends with Ranma and always gets a full story arc devoted to him. Rouge is similar, only that she appears just once (with a story arc devoted to her) and makes friends with the Tendos, also, her cursed form is powerful enough to consider her stronger than the regular cast.

Finally, while Taro is from China, so are Herb, Rouge and Saffron, but they were agreed to belong into the major adversaries category.[[User:Facer|Facer]] 16:19, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:... Looks like you're being ignored there Facer.  I say put the protected status back.  [[User:Derekloffin|Derekloffin]] 18:28, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

::You're right Derek, but I don't want to fall into a trick that would make me break the 3 revert rule; it's a common practice by anons to try to have registered users like us falling for that. I'll just leave the template like it is for now and tomorrow or over the weekend, I'll protect it again (or you could change it back to my last edit and protect it if you want), that's just to give the anons a chance to post their part here. 
::But now that I think of it, anon user {{userlinks|129.133.140.172}}, who according to his WHOIS logs from Middletown, Connecticut, was also causing trouble to the folks who maintain the [[Urusei Yatsura]] pages. I'm not against this anon contributing with the pages; it's just that it would help if he/she stopped acting like an overenthusiastic, stubborn fanatic who hates to discuss his points of view.

I'll end this war right now with my explanation. I am reclassifying certain characters to better fit their roles in the series. For Ryoga and Happosai, they seem to be Ranma's greatest adversaries and thus belong under Major Adversaries. Each is around often enough to be seen as a major character, not just a recurring/minor character. As for Pantyhose Taro, he is a native of China, born near Jusenkyo in fact. I feel that since that is a major part of how he got to be the way he is, he should be classified under Chinese. Additionally, he doesn't appear often enough to merit being called a Major Adversary, although he's around often enough to play a fairly large role. I had one more reason to change it as I did: arranging it like this reduces the amount of empty space present on each line. From here on, I will focus on the articles only, generally in terms of grammar and spelling, as they're often atrocious. Anon user {{userlinks|129.133.140.172}} 14:22, 16 November 2006</text>

==Foodstuff==

Re your edit on [[meatball]], 'foodstuff' is actually a good word of formal English, meaning something like 'food material'.  That said, 'food' is more appropriate in the context where you changed it.  --[[User:Macrakis|Macrakis]] 17:04, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

== October 2008 ==

[[Image:Information.png|25px]] Welcome to Wikipedia. The &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexualism?diff=247163622 recent edit]&lt;/span&gt; you made to [[:Transsexualism]] has been reverted, as it appears to have removed content from the page without explanation. Use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]] for testing; if you believe the edit was constructive, ensure that you provide an informative [[Help:Edit summary|edit summary]]. You may also wish to read the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|introduction to editing]]. Thank you. &lt;!-- Template:uw-huggledelete1 --&gt; [[User:Alexius08|Alexius08]] ([[User talk:Alexius08|talk]]) 13:16, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

== Sorry about that ==

It was an attack by a long term vandal who is very good at generating confusion. I accidentally jumped on your edit without stopping to see what was going on. My own stupid fault entirely. --[[User:Closedmouth|Closedmouth]] ([[User talk:Closedmouth|talk]]) 13:35, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

== Flag bearers ==

[[Wikipedia:Reference desk]] would be the place to ask. Cheers [[User:Jim1138|Jim1138]] ([[User talk:Jim1138|talk]]) 20:49, 23 July 2014 (UTC) [[User:Jim1138|Jim1138]] ([[User talk:Jim1138|talk]]) 20:49, 23 July 2014 (UTC)</text>

==License tagging for Image:Umfm Logo 2006.jpg==
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Umfm Logo 2006.jpg]].  Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated.  Images need to have an [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|image tag]] applied to the [[Wikipedia:Image description page|image description page]] indicating the copyright status of the image.  This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.

For more information on using images, see the following pages:
*[[Wikipedia:Image use policy]]
*[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]]

This is an automated notice by [[User:OrphanBot|OrphanBot]].  If you need help on selecting a tag to use, or in adding the tag to the image description, feel free to post a message at [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]]. 21:08, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

==Orphaned non-free media (Image:Umfm.jpg)==
[[Image:Ambox warning blue.svg|25px]] Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Umfm.jpg]]'''. The media description page currently specifies that it is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a [[WP:FU|claim of fair use]]. However, it is currently [[Wikipedia:Orphan|orphaned]], meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the media was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. [[WP:BOLD|You may add it back]] if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that media for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable for use on Wikipedia (see [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Policy|our policy for non-free media]]).

If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|my contributions]]&quot; link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting &quot;Image&quot; from the dropdown box. Note that all non-free media not used in any '''articles''' will be deleted after seven days, as described on [[wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Orphaned --&gt; [[User:BJBot|BJBot]] ([[User talk:BJBot|talk]]) 05:16, 23 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[[:Sally hall]]==

A tag has been placed on [[:Sally hall]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Sally hall|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, article #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.&lt;!-- Template:Nn-warn --&gt;  See also [[WP:SPAM]].

'''Desmond Arthur Peter Leslie''' (29 June 1921, London – 21 February 2001, [[Antibes]], [[France]]) was a British pilot, film maker, writer, and musician, of English, Irish and Scottish descent. He was the younger son, and youngest child, of [[Shane Leslie]], and his wife Marjorie (née Ide) Leslie. His father was a first cousin of [[Sir Winston Churchill]].

==Biography==
During his lifetime he served as a Spitfire pilot in the [[RAF]] during [[World War II]], became one of the first pioneers of electronic music, and co-authored one of the first books on [[UFO]]s, ''Flying Saucers Have Landed'' (1953),&lt;ref name=&quot;Adamski&quot;&gt;[http://www.angels-light.org/english/books/saucers/saucers.htm ''Flying Saucers Have Landed'' (1957 edition)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107203646/http://www.angels-light.org/english/books/saucers/saucers.htm |date=7 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with writer and UFO [[contactee]] [[George Adamski]].

Desmond is probably most famously known for punching theatre critic [[Bernard Levin]] in front of eleven million viewers during an edition of the live satirical TV show ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]'' in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|3EelRI_oRPY|Desmond Leslie punches Bernard Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1279720,00.html Levin's obit., ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3549674.stm BBCi]&lt;/ref&gt; Ostensibly this was to protect the honour of his then-wife, [[Agnes Bernelle]], in response to Levin's critical review of her show, ''Savagery and Delight''.

Bernelle stated in her biography, ''The Fun Palace'', that the show was poorly received due to Desmond's custom-built loudspeakers being moved below the stage, and that Desmond had failed to check the situation, missing the show for a social appointment. As a consequence no one behind the front two rows heard a word she sang. She claimed he probably punched Levin more out of embarrassment than loyalty. Levin's obituaries described Leslie only as an expert on [[UFO]]s.

==Writer==
Throughout his life, Desmond Leslie published several books, including a number on the subject of [[UFO]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_Moore&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-10985156 &quot;Sir Patrick Moore's Irish UFO film identified&quot;, BBC News Northern Ireland, 16 August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;—the first of which, ''Flying Saucers Have Landed'', was co-authored with [[George Adamski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adamski&quot; /&gt; He also wrote a series of satirical books ranging from ''The Jesus File'', dealing with the crucifixion of Christ as recorded through the paper-work and internal correspondences of the Roman Garrison, to ''How Britain Won The Space Race'', which he co-wrote with celebrated amateur astronomer Patrick Moore.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_Moore&quot; /&gt;

==Screenwriting/directing career==
Desmond Leslie was briefly a [[screenwriter]]/[[film director|director]] for [[film]] and [[television]].

* ''My Hands Are Clay'' (1947)
* ''Stranger At My Door'' (1950)
* ''[[Stranger from Venus]]'' (1954)
* ''Them And The Thing'' (1960)

During financial difficulties during the production of ''Stranger At My Door'', Desmond opted to compose the music for the film himself. Some {{who|date=April 2012}} stated the music was the best part of the film. In the early 1950s Leslie designed the world's first effective multi-track sound mixing desk which he had built by Rupert Neve. It can still be seen in his family home [[Castle Leslie]], Monaghan, where it has been an object of reverence for visitors such as [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Paul McCartney]].

==Electronic music career==
During the late 1950s, he began nurturing his interest in contemporary music. In his small home studio, he experimented with the sounds of [[musique concrète]]. In January 1960, Leslie pressed a single acetate called ''Music of the Future''. All Leslie recordings were later licensed to Joseph Weinburger, and Leslie's recordings were pressed onto a short series of 78rpm library discs, occasionally being put to use in science and mystery based programing, such as early ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes. He used a great number of tape sources to create his pieces; some sources he mentions in his liner notes are motor horns, humming tops and bells.&lt;ref name=&quot;CD_notes&quot;&gt;Leslie, Desmond: ''Music Of The Future''. Audio CD, Trunk Records (2005). Liner notes by Desmond Leslie and Jonny Trunk.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Jonny Trunk's British record label, [[Trunk Records]], re-released Desmond's 1960 acetate, never before released commercially. The sounds on this release were mastered from the original acetate. The recordings are believed to have been made between 1955 and 1959, and included are Desmond's original sleevenotes, containing information pertaining to each selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;CD_notes&quot; /&gt;

==Marriages and children==
His first wife was Agnes Elizabeth Bernauer ([[Agnes Bernelle]]) on 18 August 1945. That marriage ended in divorce. The couple had two sons and one daughter:

* Sir Shaun Rudolf Christopher Leslie, 5th Bt (b. 4 June 1947), married Charlotte Bing; no offspring. He inherited the [[Leslie Baronets|Leslie Baronetcy]], of [[County Monaghan|Glaslough, County Monaghan]], that his uncle, [[Sir John Leslie, 4th Bt.|John Leslie]], held until his death in 2016.
* Christopher Mark Leslie (b. 7 December 1952), married Cliona Manahan and had two children, Leah Leslie and Luke Leslie.
* Antonia Kelvey Oriel Leslie (b. 1963), married Colm Nolan, and raised one daughter, Lola Leslie.

He remarried, to Jennifer Helen Strong, in 1970; they had two daughters:
* Samantha Helen Leslie (b. 1966)
* Camilla Patricia Leslie (b. 29 March 1969)

==Last years and death==
During the 1990s he devoted his time to restoring the aging family home of [[Castle Leslie]] which eventually opened to the public. He later relocated to [[Nice]], [[France]]. [[Emphysema]] claimed his life in [[Antibes]] in 2001, aged 79.

== Lookover... ==

* Lead - 
** You can probably drop the &quot;Church of England priest&quot; bit from the lead. I'd go with &quot;...an English historian and Church of England Bishop of Peterborough and London.&quot;
***Done&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#E45E05&quot;&gt;[[User:Iridescent|iride]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C1118C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Iridescent|scent]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:30, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
** Isn't &quot;..to research a proposed book on the Papacy.&quot; a bit of overdetail on the lead? I'm assuming it never got published, so why is it so important it should be mentioned in the lead?
***No, he eventually did write it - as it's the book he's remembered (if at all) for today, I think it warrants a mention in the lead (presumably, most people looking him up will know him as the author of ''History of the Papacy'').&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#E45E05&quot;&gt;[[User:Iridescent|iride]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C1118C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Iridescent|scent]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:30, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
**** Then probably should make it clear that it was written. As it is currently stated, it almost makes it sound like the book didn't get written. (and if it's that well known, probably should mention the title in the lead...) [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 01:39, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
* Early life - 
** Okay, &quot;graduated in 1866 with a First in Greats.&quot; is gobbledygook to this non-Englishperson. I see they are linked, but a quickie explanation won't hurt. 
***I've explained &quot;First&quot;. [[Greats]] is one of those things that isn't really summarisable (&quot;an extended four-year course in the Latin and Greek languages, archaeology, classical literature and philosophy and the history of Greece and Rome&quot; is about as short as I can get it). How about a footnote?&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#E45E05&quot;&gt;[[User:Iridescent|iride]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C1118C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Iridescent|scent]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:30, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
**** Footnotes work! [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 01:39, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
** More jargon - Oxford Movement? What were they most known for? Remember, linking is good, but it takes your reader away from the article which they dislike a lot.
***Again, a tricky one to summarise; basically, believed that the church in England was the true Catholic church and the Papacy was the schism, and that the C of E should re-claim the pre-reformation liturgy. I'll see if Ottava can suggest anything.&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#E45E05&quot;&gt;[[User:Iridescent|iride]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C1118C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Iridescent|scent]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:30, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
** More jargon &quot;High Table&quot;?
***It's an honor given to important people in an English college - it literally is the right to eat at a separate table that's raised above the others. I've rephrased it to &quot;academics&quot;, which is slightly misleading (all academics are High Table, but not all HT are A) but still accurate.&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#E45E05&quot;&gt;[[User:Iridescent|iride]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C1118C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Iridescent|scent]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:30, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
** Do we need the details on Louise's birth? 
***We don't ''need'', but I think it adds useful background; she wasn't a typical &quot;in the background&quot; wife but a major author and activist in her own right, and the interplay between the two is so significant (aside from his wife's biography of him, there are two full-length bios of him, both of which actually devote more space to her than to him). If it didn't breach our conventions, I'd have actually titled this [[Mandell and Louise Creighton]].&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#E45E05&quot;&gt;[[User:Iridescent|iride]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C1118C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Iridescent|scent]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:30, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
* Peterborough and London - 
** Really rough transition from &quot;..and a novel, the Bloom of the Peach, under the pseudonum of Lois Hale.&quot; to &quot;Mandell Creighton was a popular and conscientious...&quot; When was Creighton consecrated? Where? When was he enthroned in his cathedral? (If you don't have access to this information, I can get it for you from the Handbook of British Chronology).
***If you can get the actual dates, please do. All I can find are years; ''Life and Letters'' has the date of his ''invitation'' but not the actual enthronements.&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#E45E05&quot;&gt;[[User:Iridescent|iride]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C1118C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Iridescent|scent]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:30, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
** Need the translation date for him going to London also.
***Ditto&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#E45E05&quot;&gt;[[User:Iridescent|iride]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C1118C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Iridescent|scent]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:30, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
* The main thing I noted was that there is a bit much on his wife. Best to move the details on her life to her own article.
**See above; normally I'd barely mention the wife, but I think she had such an impact on him (and vice versa) that she needs to be gone into quite heavily. She will get her own article at some point; at that time I'll see what if anything can be moved across.&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#E45E05&quot;&gt;[[User:Iridescent|iride]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C1118C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Iridescent|scent]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:30, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

::: The prose is still a bit rough, but most of the important facts seem in place, your sources are good, and the non-Brit jargon that flew in my face I've pointed out above. I'm sure Malleus will catch prose glitches, he's very very good at that. Looks pretty good! Thinking GA or FA for this one? [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 01:44, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
::::Maybe; at the moment there's a [[User:Iridescent/BCH|giant userspace slushpile]] from which I'm spinning off assorted parts when they become big enough to stand alone (including my favorite article title, [[Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants]], and my [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Iridescent/BCH&amp;oldid=313108081#cite_note-77 favorite footnote]). I'll wait and see what's left when the dust settles; what I'm hoping to do is use the one on the house as the &quot;trunk&quot; (buildings have the advantage of not dying), with assorted redlinks and expanded stubs as the fruit. Ideally, what will be left once all the subtopics are split off is a &quot;social history&quot; article similar to [[Noel Park]].&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#E45E05&quot;&gt;[[User:Iridescent|iride]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C1118C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Iridescent|scent]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:57, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

== Handbook dates... ==

Okay, Handbook of British Chronology (you can find the bibliographical details in any of the bishop FAs I've done, it's the third edition). Mandell Creighton nominated 2 March 1891 to Peterborough, consecrated 25 April 1891. translated 15 Jan 1897 to London.  He was nominated for London on 31 Dec 1896, and confirmed to London on 15 Jan 1897. The Peterborough dates are from page 265, the London dates from page 260.

== One more thing... ==

Probably should cover more on his impact as a historian. Did he have famous students? Did his work inspire others? A bit more on how long he was editor of EHR wouldn't be bad, did he set editorial policy? [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 12:24, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

:I tried to follow roughly the proportions of &quot;bishop-related&quot;/&quot;historian related&quot; as his [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32626 DNB article] (subscription required if you're outside the UK), on the grounds that their assessment of the relative importance of each is probably fair. I'll see if I can fluff it out regarding ''EHR'' (he was editor for 5 years). I'm not aware of any famous students, or at least students who cited him as an influence (I'm sure he must have had some, but nobody seems to think they're worth mentioning). He was a [[Rede Lecture|Rede Lecturer]] and a [[Hulsean Lecturer]], which if you know academic conventions of the period are a Big Deal but would be incomprehensible to 99.9% of the population. [[Lytton Strachey]] had intended Creighton as the fifth subject of ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'', but abandoned the section and published the book with only four biographies instead of five - I've been trying to think of ways to incorporate that but it's difficult to explain why someone ''not'' being mentioned in a book is notable.&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#E45E05&quot;&gt;[[User:Iridescent|iride]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C1118C&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Iridescent|scent]]&lt;/font&gt; 13:18, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

:: I checked for him in Cantor's ''Inventing the Middle Ages'' but he's not mentioned. Another source you might hunt in is the EHR, they probably ran an obit. Check Transactions of the Royal Historical Society also, I'm not sure if they started publishing then or not. [[User:Ealdgyth|Ealdgyth]] - [[User talk:Ealdgyth|Talk]] 13:36, 11 September 2009 (UTC)

:Have worked those parts that seem appropriate in, along with a long footnote about [[John Kensit]] (longer than our actual article on the man!) to try to give some more background to the schism in the Church of England during the period. I don't think the relationship with Stubbs is worth mentioning; it doesn't appear, from what I can see, than would be expected of two academics working in the same field at the same time. Creighton's famous relationship, if there is one, would be that with Lord Acton, which spawned That Quote so beloved of agitators and rabble-rousers ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;redirs=1&amp;search=absolute+power+corrupts+absolutely&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;ns1=1&amp;ns2=1&amp;ns3=1&amp;ns4=1&amp;ns5=1&amp;ns6=1&amp;ns7=1&amp;ns8=1&amp;ns9=1&amp;ns10=1&amp;ns11=1&amp;ns12=1&amp;ns13=1&amp;ns14=1&amp;ns15=1&amp;ns100=1&amp;ns101=1&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;advanced=1&amp;fulltext=Advanced+search 1528 usages on Wikipedia policy and talk pages] at the time of writing!), and is duly covered in the article.

== Louise von Glehn ==

Do we need the redlink to Louise? I've been reading [[wp:redlink]] and I can't see whether the link fulfils the criteria for being left in, or should be removed. She does have most of a paragraph to herself here ... is she independently notable and is there enough verifiable information on her to sustain her own article, or is she best left being dealt with here? And if we do need one redlink, do we really need two? Best wishes, [[User:DisillusionedBitterAndKnackered|DBaK]] ([[User talk:DisillusionedBitterAndKnackered|talk]]) 23:00, 20 October 2009 (UTC)

==Rewrite==
I am rewriting the article, making it more accurate, and using a better set of sources.  (I had earlier been writing the article on my subpage [[User:Fowler%26fowler/Mandell_Creighton]].)  The page will necessarily be in an unfinished state (and too long for its own good) while I do this.  Please bear with me.  Whatever is of value in the previous version, will be incorporated into the article later.  The previous version itself was created in mainspace on 11 September 2008 in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mandell_Creighton&amp;diff=313104695&amp;oldid=306124882 one major rewrite] of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mandell_Creighton&amp;oldid=306124882 still earlier version], which while being poorly sourced, and perhaps only minimally paraphrased from the 1911 Britannica, was in some respects more accurate.

*I'm not altogether comfortable with the implied spectrum &quot;radical evangelicals and conservative Anglo-Catholics&quot;. Evangelicals have usually tended towards very conservative social views. On the other hand, Anglo-catholicism has sometimes been allied to political radicalism - as I discovered when I studied ritualism in the Victorian Church of England.

I discovered that some of the pictures we thought had uncertain copyright have in fact appeared in the two volumes: {{citation|author=Louise Creighton|title=Life and letters of Mandell Creighton, volume 1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EMQUAAAAQAAJ|year=1904|publisher=Longmans, Green}}, {{citation|last=Creighton|first=Louise|title=Life and letters of Mandell Creighton, volume 2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IcQUAAAAQAAJ|year=1904|publisher=Longmans, Green}}.  I will be adding more info here soon.

== Suggestions ==

I must admit that this article is so much improved since I last touched it that I'm nervous about contributing directly. I did wonder, though, if the following should be considered:
#There is no link in the text to the vicarage building, [[Embleton Tower]]. There is, correctly, a link there from the photo caption; since the text mentions the vicarage, the building, pele towers an ting might it not be good if it also linked to the building's own article?
#The (rather good) village hall in Embleton is called the Creighton Memorial Hall. I don't know when this happened or what the whole story is, but I feel it may be noteworthy in terms of his relationship with the village ... at least it draws a contrast with the villager's 'no good ... no harm' comment! 
#Similarly, but perhaps less excitingly, there are a number of things probably or definitely named after him in London. For example there are roads in (at least) E6, N2, W12, NW6, N17, and W5. This is certainly a type of legacy which differs from a foundation, lecture, scholarship or whatever but I am not sure that it is of no value, representing, perhaps, a certain type of er er ''civic'' recognition. What do you think?
Best wishes, [[User:DisillusionedBitterAndKnackered|DBaK]] ([[User talk:DisillusionedBitterAndKnackered|talk]]) 14:38, 27 December 2011 (UTC)
:Thanks.  I like the ideas!  
:1. I apparently wikified the [[Embleton Tower]] page two years ago, and then forgot all about it.  I see that [[user:Rosiestep]] has done a lot of work there recently.  Will do.
:2. Will look for refs for Creighton Memorial Hall.  If you have any, please post.
:3 Do you have any refs for the roads?    [[User:Fowler&amp;amp;fowler|&lt;font color=&quot;#B8860B&quot;&gt;Fowler&amp;amp;fowler&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Fowler&amp;amp;fowler|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot;&gt;«Talk»&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:15, 27 December 2011 (UTC)
::Question: DBaK, do you know if [http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanstanton/4863823709/ this Creighton Road] in London is named after Mandell Creighton?  It has the right (i.e. uploadable to WP) licensing on Flickr.

==To do list==
#Expand lead to be more representative of article.
#Incorporate suggestions by DBaK in Legacy section.
#Look for new refs that might have appeared since October 2009.  [[User:Fowler&amp;amp;fowler|&lt;font color=&quot;#B8860B&quot;&gt;Fowler&amp;amp;fowler&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Fowler&amp;amp;fowler|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot;&gt;«Talk»&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:09, 27 December 2011 (UTC)
==References published after publication of Covert's biography==
James Covert's ''A Victorian Marriage: Mandell and Louise Creighton'' is the only modern biography of Creighton.  It was published in 2000 (and has preface dated December 1999).  Although I had thought I had scoured the literature for other authors (especially ones published ''after'' 2000), I apparently hadn't.  Most (read three-quarters) modern references to Creighton are perfunctory ones which (perfunctorily) mention Acton's remark, &quot;Power corrupts ...,&quot; and (more perfunctorily) mention Creighton as the recipient of it.  Consequently, I had to block out &quot;Acton&quot; in the binary search.  Here then is a list for the period 1999 to 2007.  I will add the more recent ones later.  Please feel free to add others.  [[User:Fowler&amp;amp;fowler|&lt;font color=&quot;#B8860B&quot;&gt;Fowler&amp;amp;fowler&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Fowler&amp;amp;fowler|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot;&gt;«Talk»&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:46, 29 December 2011 (UTC)
:PS This is not a list generated by a computer program though it might seem like one.  :) I had to go through each reference.  [[User:Fowler&amp;amp;fowler|&lt;font color=&quot;#B8860B&quot;&gt;Fowler&amp;amp;fowler&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Fowler&amp;amp;fowler|&lt;font color=&quot;#708090&quot;&gt;«Talk»&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:50, 29 December 2011 (UTC)
::PPS I know this is an overkill, but it might be good to have the refs in one place.

==Brewing liquor==
I have a co worker with extensive experience in the water treatment industry who assures me that campden tablets or any other kind of sulfite will *not* drive off chloramines, they can only be removed via filtering through activated charcoal.  I'm not ready to disbelieve you, or him just yet, but a citation (preferably chemistry-based) would be nice. [[User:MalkavianX|MalkavianX]] 20:17, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

== Merger with Homebrewing ==

*Moved Merger comments to [[Talk:Homebrewing#Merger]]

== Error in Full Mash section's rule of thumb re. temp &amp; pH ==

The &quot;Full Mash&quot; section contains an error in the description of mash temp &amp; pH for α-amylase vs. β-amylase.   The paragraph says that β-amylase produces fermentable sugars and prefers higher temperature and higher (more alkaline) pH, and that α-amylase produces non-fermentable dextrins and prefers lower temp &amp; pH; but then it goes on to say &quot;the hotter and more alkaline the mash, the drier and more alcoholic the final beer; the cooler and more acidic the mash, the sweeter and thicker&quot;.

This is contradictory because &quot;drier and more alcoholic&quot; implies the wort had more fermentable sugars and less dextrins, which the preceeding text says is produced by α-amylase, which (it says) prefers cooler and more acidic conditions.

I suspect the mistake is that ''β-amylase'' is the main producer of fermentable sugars, not α-amylase, and β is denatured at a LOWER temp than α-amylase (65°C for β vs. 70+°C for α).  Therefore a ''cooler and more alkaline'' mash should produce drier and more alcoholic beer, and usually the temperature is all that matters (both α and β tolerate pH 5.0-6.0).


Will some expert chime in and/or fix the text?   It is clearly inconsistent, but I don't have enough personal experience to warrant changing the text myself.   The information I provided above is based on John Palmer's &quot;How to Brew&quot; book (Ch. 14 &quot;How Mashing Works&quot;).  The online version is at http://www.howtobrew.com .
Here is a quote from Palmer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A lower mash temperature, less than or equal to 150°F [65°C], yields a thinner bodied, drier beer. A higher mash temperature, greater than or equal to 156°F [69°C], yields a less fermentable, sweeter beer. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I'm still a relative newcomer here myself but I was happy to see your email on the Lunar listserve this afternoon.  I too have been dismayed at the state of the Lunar information here.  I hope your call for help brings a few more lunatics out of the woodwork to help clean this stuff up. [[User:IntrplnetSarah|IntrplnetSarah]] 20:17, 30 October 2006 (UTC) (aka Sarah Noble)

== a bit too enthusiast? ==
&quot;Lunokhod&quot;: who are you to assign quality and importance ratings to articles?  You assign &quot;start-class&quot; to many articles that have been developed for a long time and are stable and mature; also I did not see any references to a proper review or the criteria that led you to such a verdict: so I find it hard to take these classifications seriously.  I believe essentially these are just your own personal, and not informed consensus, opinions.  Nonetheless you boldly do put such official-looking assessments on the pages, possibly confusing or misleading readers. [[User:Tom Peters|Tom Peters]] 12:07, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
:Hi Tom - I was just tagging all of the articles that fall under the newly created domain of [[WP:Moon|WikiProject Moon]], and some of these could be in error. If you join the project, feel free to change these assessments. Before doing so though, have a look at the list of assessed articles, as the grading is indeed relative. As for the &quot;importance&quot;, it is important to realize that this is only a relative internal scale within the WikiProject. A low importance under &quot;Moon&quot; could be a high importance under &quot;space exploration.&quot; Also, for the class, stability was not a criteria in assigning preliminary values. When looking at the page I asked myself &quot;Is the length and detail of discussion of the article appropriate for the topic?&quot; and &quot;How much work needs to bring this to being a relatively complete page that would appear in a printed version of an encyclopedia.&quot; Sorry if I offended anyone here. Please sign up with the Moon WikiProject! [[User:Lunokhod|Lunokhod]] 12:36, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
: One more thing, without going through the good article nomination process, the highest class that can be assigned in &quot;B&quot;. [[User:Lunokhod|Lunokhod]] 13:08, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

::TP: OK, understood: but then I like to remark that you shouldn't assess the article - even if only for your project - without writing down what's good and bad about it.  Also on the &quot;printed encyclopedia&quot; criterium: one thing that strikes me seeing Wikipedia develop is, that compared to a printed encyclopedia it has much more generous size restraints.  So all kinds of digressions are possible, and sub-topics are spawning all the time (and sometimes merging); because of the hyperlinks the cross-references work much easier than in a printed version.  Also I've found Wikipedia a convenient place to collect and store information that is hard to find in decent quality elsewhere online.  e.g. [[Computus]], [[New moon]], [[Full moon cycle]].

::After some reflection, I think I will not join your project:
::* I don't have that much free time to keep up with the activity that you have been displaying
::* Your focus seems to be on selenophysics; mine is on ephemerides, history, and calendrics.

::One more comment: if I read your project page well, you say you want to make the articles useful even to post-graduate specialists.  That is a very tiny group, and not the audience for a general encyclopedia.  For example, I did get complaints that my writings are too technical, and personally I find most mathematics articles too high-level.  I find it OK for specialists to use Wikipedia to explain their arcane science to a wider audience (see e.g. [[Full moon cycle]]). [[User:Tom Peters|Tom Peters]] 14:19, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

::: In any case, feel free to leave comments on the project banner regarding the class and importance criteria. These are collected automatically by a bot every day. The importance class is something that Wikipedia definitely needs to explain better before they go to print with version 1.0. Perhaps there is a project related to celestial mechanics, or perhaps astronomy itself that might be useful for improving orbital mechanics related topics. I'll be checking back on these pages in a week or so and will try to leave more detailed comments. [[User:Lunokhod|Lunokhod]] 15:59, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

==Can you please explain why you deleted the line and reference for the double planet section of &quot;Definition of Planet&quot;?==

That was a perfectly good scholarly reference. Also, the newly revamped Double Planet article you linked to makes the same claim (only in more abstract terms) but is not referenced. I would appreciate a response on this; I plan to revert the change if no explanation is forthcoming.[http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/convex.html This article] makes it perfectly clear that the Moon has a convex orbit around the Sun; it isn't simply a matter of relative gravitational pull. [[User:Serendipodous|Serendipodous]] 13:32, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
: Please see the discussion at [[Orbit of the Moon]] and [[double planet]] for further discussion of this point. My main objections are the following
# If you were to instantly transfer the Earth-Moon system to the outer edges of the solar system, then the Moon's orbit would no longer be like that of the Earth, but would loop back upon itself like the Galilean satelites do (in a Sun centered non-rotating coordinate system, of course). Therefore this definition is not consistent. Two Earth-Moon systems at different radii from the Sun would be called two different things.
# If you were to &quot;turn off&quot; the gravity of the Sun (obviously you can't), then the Moon would continue to orbit the Earth with the same sidereal period. Asimov's &quot;tug-of-war&quot; analogy does not adequately describe the physics of the situation.
# &quot;The journal of theoretics&quot; (in my very humble opinion as a scientists who reads the literature concerning orbital dynamics and geophysics) is very &quot;gray&quot;, and the article itself is not scholarly. There are more citations in a typical wikipedia entry than in this article.
# From reading the [[double planet]] page, it is clearly stated that Asimov's attempt at a definition is very poor, and that the scientific community does not use it because of its inherent flaws. I don't understand why you state otherwise.
: I am not denying that the orbit of the Moon is everywhere convex; my objection is that this is a very poor way of defining what a double-planet system is. You are welcome to revert the changes, but then you will have to defend your changes on the talk page! [[User:Lunokhod|Lunokhod]] 14:00, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
::Which you did not do :-/ Regardless, I still do not fully understand your point. Obviously, if the Earth-Moon system were to shift to the farthest reaches of the Solar system, the pull of the Sun's gravity would be weaker, and the Moon would fall under the gravitational influence of the Earth, but that isn't the case. The Earth-Moon system is where it is, and for this reason the Moon has a convex orbit around the Sun. You could just as easily say that if the Moon were shifted between Earth and Venus, it would become a planet. [[User:Serendipodous|Serendipodous]] 14:41, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
:::&quot;if the Earth-Moon system were to shift to the farthest reaches of the Solar system, the pull of the Sun's gravity would be weaker, and the Moon would fall under the gravitational influence of the Earth&quot; This is not true. The whole point is that the sidereal period of the Moon (i.e., its orbital period with respect to the &quot;fixed&quot; stars&quot;) does NOT depend on the Earth-Sun distance! Technically, this is because the Moon lies within the Earth's gravitational sphere of infuence (the Hill sphere); its orbit around the Earth has nothing to do with the Sun (ok, I'm neglecting some second order interactions). For the Earth-Moon system, convexity only depends on the Earth-Sun distance. Thus, (in my opinion) it would not be a good idea to use the &quot;convexity&quot; criterion for distinguishing between double-planet and primary-satelite systems. 
:::The problem with the convexity argument is the following. Consider an Earth-Moon system identical to ours, but placed in the Kuiper belt. The moon around this twin Earth would make one orbit about its primary in exactly 27.2 days, just like our Moon does. However, when viewed from a non-rotating coordinate system centered at the Sun, this twin moon would sometimes appear to go backwards, or even make loops. Now, why should the Earth-Moon system be called a double planet system and not this one? They are exactly the same, with the exception that one system goes around the Sun faster than the other. To me, it is like saying &quot;This is an orange because it is on the ground 1 meter from an orange tree, but another object that looks exactly like an orange at 2 meters distance from the tree is not.&quot; [[User:Lunokhod|Lunokhod]] 15:13, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
::::Titan has active volcanoes, a substantial atmosphere, weathering, even standing liquids on its surface. It is, for all intents and purposes, a terrestrial planet; indeed, from a purely physical standpoint, it probably has more claim to the title than Venus or Mercury. But we don't call it that; we call it a satellite because it happens to be in orbit around Saturn. It is classified by a fluke of its position, just as the Moon would be if it were called a double planet. Even the word &quot;planet&quot;, by decree of the IAU, has an arbitrary element based on location. If we took any of the eight official planets out of their orbits and threw them into interstellar space, they wouldn't be planets anymore. The convexity argument has, if anything, more validity than the IAU's planet definition. [[User:Serendipodous|Serendipodous]] 15:28, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
::::: I kind of agree with you, but this is completely unrelated to a definition based on orbital mechanics. Personally, I work with the Moon on a day to day basis, and I often refer to it as a planet based on it complex geologic history. As for the convexity argument (again) consider the following: If we were to replace the Moon of Earth with a body the size of Phobos, its orbit would be everywhere convex as well. Would you call this Earth-Phobos system a double planet? To be absurd, you could replace Phobos with a peanut: It would still have the exact same orbital period as our Moon, and the peanut's orbit would be convex, when viewed from a non-rotating reference system centered at the Sun. There is good reason that the scientific community does not to use Asimov's definition, even though many planetary scientists are fans of his work. [[User:Lunokhod|Lunokhod]] 15:41, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
::::::Neither a peanut nor Phobos would be a planet, because, according to the official definition, a planet has to possess hydrostatic equilibrium. The Moon possesses hydrostatic equilibrium, orbits the Sun and, if we count the Earth-Moon system as a double planet, is gravitationally dominant in its neighborhood. It therefore meets all the criteria for planethood set out by the IAU. [[User:Serendipodous|Serendipodous]] 17:32, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
:::::::You haven't responded to my questions. I would appreciate an answer within the next 24 hours, otherwise I will revert your deletion. Thank you. [[User:Serendipodous|Serendipodous]] 23:05, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
:::::::: As you tacitly acknowledged, if the Moon were the size of a peanut, and if the IAU did not define a planet as being in hyrdrostatic equilibrium, you would call the Earth-peanut system a double planet. This is a totally ad-hoc definition, because if I made the peanut out of mercury (a metal that is molten at the average temperature of the Moon) it would then meet your definition of a double planet. You are free to add what you want to the text. I am also free to add an explanation as to why your definition makes no sense. You should realize that a wikipedia encylopedia article should reflect the consensus and divergences within the scientific community, and your definition has (as far as I know) never been advocated by a scientist that is knowledgable in this domain. [[User:Lunokhod|Lunokhod]] 01:10, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
:::::::::Your objection has more to do with the IAU's definition of planet than with any of the issues at stake here. If you wish to discuss that issue, it is raised (at least as regards rock vs. ice) in the &quot;Hydrostatic equilibrium&quot; section as one of the problems with the definition as it stands. I cannot find anything on Google Scholar other than that citation you deleted that directly references the issue, although there are many scholarly papers that refer to the Earth-Moon system as a double planet. On that basis I will have to concede the argument, unless I can locate a source that you will accept. However, I don't know why the Moon's orbit around the Sun cannot be mentioned at all, even if it is only to refute the argument. I would accept a refutation of the argument if it meant at least discussing the Moon's solar orbit. [[User:Serendipodous|Serendipodous]] 01:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

== GA nominee comment ==

I took a look at Venus and Mercury.  Confirmed my main point that criteria 1a and 1b are where the Moon article needs work:  The featured articles have compelling prose, jargon explained, readily accessible to a non-specialist audience.  The Venus article in particular has very nice writing, it just flows effortlessly, it doesn't put you to sleep or make your eyes cross.  The introduction is particularly excellent, providing a nice basic overview.  While still not super accessible to the third grader (!), at least the average parent can figure it out without needing a degree in physics!  If we figure Wikipedia is more Britannica than World Book (which actually writes different articles to different reading levels based on what grades usually study a given subject, BTW), it works.  In short, the biggest difference between Moon and the featured articles is in style and readability, though of the sections in Moon still need rearranging to flow more logically, even if you keep the &quot;fun&quot; stuff at the end the way the other articles do...hope this helps.

== No Original Research at the Village Pump ==

Lunokhod: regarding our controversy on the NOR policy: I submitted my case at the [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|Village Pump]].  You probably want to respond. [[User:Tom Peters|Tom Peters]] 14:27, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

You're disputing in good company. At least he has the class to give you a heads-up. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#Extent_of_.22No_Original_Research.22_policy.3F Here's a quicklink]. I'm interested in hearing your take on this given the logic I'd applied before seeing your claim to a PHD. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;emsp;I'd also suggested that out of respect for the holiday season, Tom Peters take his time in re-generating his derivations and tacking them into the talk or a subpage for inspection. They've been in place for a long while, so there is no hurry, as if it were new content under fire. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;emsp;I'd prefer you both work on the English around the math in the iterim. It needs dumbed down so a 7th-8th grader can at least get the gist. Kudos on jumping in with both feet on the Moon Project, that's ballsy, given the learning curve and your newish status. If you have a question on generalities, etc., I'm on the [[WP:Wc]], and glad to lend an assist.

== Reply: better reference for lunar ephemerides ==

Lunokhod: thanx for the reference suggestion on my talk page.  I do have all Meeus's Morsels books: they provide various curiosa in celestial dynamics, but little on exactly how they were computed; in any case no new parameters or formulae.  I asked Meeus but he replied that at his age (he is in his 70's) he does not consider updating his &quot;Astronomical Algorithms&quot;.  
On our controversy on Original Research: I remain skeptical that any of this could be published in a common journal, especially since much of the stuff has been available in Wikipedia for some time.  However, maybe the Academia Wikia is a proper place for digests of newer literature.  I started a broad journal [http://academia.wikia.com/wiki/Time_and_Space here].  Would you spend time to referee such publications? [[User:Tom Peters|Tom Peters]] 01:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

: I think that I am just going to try to edit the pages for clarity in a week or two after I do a little reading on this subject. My first priority is to clean up [[Saros cycle]], as this is the cylcle that most poeple know about. [[Eclipse cycle]] is so esotric that I doubt anyone ever looks at it. I was hoping that I could get the main author interested in improving these pages, but as you noted, he seems to think that they are already cystal clear. If every edit I make is contested, then more drastic measures might be needed. [[User:Lunokhod|Lunokhod]] 11:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

== Moon and solar system footers ==

''Hi. Would it be possible to make these footers collapse to a single line, as opposed to two lines? Also, is there a way to set the default as to whether the footer is initially open or collapsed? For the Moon footer, under most situations, think that it would be best to have this by default open.[[User:Lunokhod|Lunokhod]] 00:44, 12 January 2007 (UTC)''
:The initial state of collapsing (when using &lt;code&gt;class=&quot;collapsible&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) is controlled by an additional class (&lt;tt&gt;autocollapse&lt;/tt&gt; &amp; &lt;tt&gt;collapsed&lt;/tt&gt;) if no additional classes are given the navbox remains open.  Possibly the bet overview on the entire collapsing is the bottom table at {{tl|Navigational templates}}.

==Basin Groups AfD==
I have found two reputable authorities for the [[Basin Groups]] Stage as a subdivision of the Pre-Nectarian. Take a look at the [http://www.stratigraphy.org/geowhen/stages/Basin_Groups.html GeoWhen database] and
[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521387655&amp;id=xbKJV6LSeggC&amp;pg=RA1-PA10&amp;lpg=RA1-PA10&amp;ots=j36n5jbtT9&amp;dq=%22basin+groups%22+cryptic&amp;sig=bg339lZw7ml_VptEfw5ifaF06eI Harland, Walter Brian '', et al.'' (1989) ''A Geologic Time Scale 1989'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK,  Fig. 1.7 on page 10], available via Google books, which shows both Basin Groups and Cryptic.  Unfortunately the textual discussion is not available as part of the Google offering.  I do realize that at present these subdivisions remain more theoretical than real, as many lunar deposits are still just lumped together as Pre-Imbrian age materials, which may account for the absence of mention of Basin Groups in Wilhelms' book and Martel's article. --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] 01:34, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

==Subdivision of the Hadean==
I did not graft lunar timescale onto the Earth.  I am only reporting what has happened in the literature.  We do not do original research here.  If you don't like the fact that some people in the field of geology have decided that the early histories of the Moon and the Earth are close enough to each other that the same time scale is appropriate, take it up with them in the appropriate forum, which is not Wikipedia.  The fact that the Devonian was first established in England, did not stop geologists from using it in the New World.  As editors we don't dictate what goes into science, we report what scientists say, in their publications. Please do not remove properly cited reliable information just because &quot;This is really bizarre.&quot; and you think that it isn't the way things should be done. Do try to get a hold of a copy of Harland, Walter Brian , et al. (1989) ''A Geologic Time Scale 1989'' and read what he has to say in the text portion.  It is not selenologists who are using these subdivisions, it is geologists, probably mostly cosmologists, so it is not surprising that these subdivisions are not mentioned in Wilhelms' book and Martel's article about the Moon. --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] 18:24, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
*Actually by &quot;cosmologist&quot; I was thinking more about people running the gamut from 
George Gamov to Immanuel Velikovsky.  Nothing against geochemists, especially John P. Marble.(c.1900-1955). &quot;were at least trained in terrestrial geology before specializing in planetary geology. (The converse is generally not true.)&quot;  I agree, Armstrong had not even landed on the moon when I took most of my geology and mineralogy coursework.

== Hi ==

Hi Mr/ Miss Lunokhod,

I am aware that you are an expert in [[planetary science]], recommended by [[User:Dr. Submillimeter|Dr. Submillimeter]]. As a member of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Abandoned Articles]], i was wondering if you would possibly be interested in the article: [[Caves of Mars Project]].

== Gravitor/Carfiend ==

I share your concerns that they might still be the same guy even though the admin concluded that they weren't. The fact is that their approach to this subject makes them nearly indistinguishable from each other. But if he/they get too belligerent (again, like last summer) we can &quot;take them to court&quot;, as it were. I have pretty much shyed away from the &quot;independent evidence&quot; page, because (as I stated there, and which Gravitor seemed not even to notice), I don't trust that character's motives. So I'm waiting to see what he comes up with. Then we'll see if Carfiend comes in and says, &quot;See, there's no real evidence&quot;, as I suspect Gravitor's agenda is. What a hassle. Just imagine what the Theory of Evolution page must be like. [[User:Wahkeenah|Wahkeenah]] 13:12, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
*I'll tell you what I told [[User:Numskll]]: That I think we should &quot;boycott&quot; the page for awhile, not engage those guys in discussion, let them do what they want with the page, and see if they either go away or if they try to accelerate the engagement. Much as that runs counter to our instincts, it's what these Siamese-twin users are counting on, and it enables them to play their game. It's just like it was last summer with these guys - endless arguments over the obvious. There was an RFC on Carfiend, who was the more aggressive of the two at that time, but it died because they both disappeared in mid-September, maybe waiting for the heat to cool off. Typically they become fixated on one issue. Their current game is to pretend this Independent Evidence page has nothing to do with the hoax - a justifiable argument, ''if'' we didn't already know (1) where it originated, on the hoax page and (2) what their point of view on the subject is. [[User:Wahkeenah|Wahkeenah]] 10:50, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
**A new RFC might be worth pursuing. I wonder if it's against the rules to specify two users in the same RFC? Or to re-open the old one about Carfiend at the same time as pursuing a new one against Gravitor? The concern I have is that I'm not yet certain he's taken it to last summer's level, although he's approaching it. I wonder if it would be worthwhile to just take the page off our watch lists for about a month and then come back see if (1) he's done any more work on it and (2) whether the result is usable or if it's just a cynical ploy. [[User:Wahkeenah|Wahkeenah]] 11:11, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
***I see, an RFC on content rather than a user. That would be a good step. I'm thinking it's actually called a request for mediation, but I'm not totally sure, as I don't do much of that kind of activity. I think that [[User:Numskll]] had done the RFC on Carfiend last summer, and that [[User:Bubba73]] had done a request for mediation on the ridiculous question of what the word &quot;rendezvous&quot; means. The former died due to the (temporary) exit of Carfiend as an editor, and the latter died when Bubba73 found positive proof that the Russians had willfully deceived the public in the way they used that term. Come to think of it, that's when Carfiend left, and Gravitor soon followed. Carfiend had been shown up, and the game wasn't fun any more. Anyway, you could talk to those guys for advice about how to do this, or you could find an admin, if the process is unclear from the documentation.

== Personal attacks ==

Gravitor, you have been making a series of personal attacks ([[WP:NPA]]) and uncivil comments ([[WP:Civility]]) that are in violation of wikipedia policy. I am going to ask kindly, once again, that you refrain from doing so.
::Look, your insistence on double standards makes strains my politeness sometimes. I'm sorry if you find me rude sometimes, but let me explain:
 As examples, 
#Saying that my &quot;dishonesty is tiresome&quot;, as you did me on the &quot;indedependent eveidence&quot; page, is not only uncivil and a personal attack, but also is a violation of assuming good faith ([[WP:AGF]]). 
::You dishonesty is tiresome. Unfortunately, you have shown yourself not to be trustworthy.
#Calling me &quot;untrustworthy&quot; violates [[WP:AGF]]. 
::I assume good faith where there is any doubt at all. You do not follow through on what you say.
#Telling me that I am on a POV crusade or Jihad is not only attack, but culturally insulting.
::You have made it clear that if you don't get your way, you will try again to delete the page. To me that is a religiously driven, destructive campaign. Suggest a better word if you want.
# Telling numskll to &quot;Eat your own dog food&quot; is a personal attack and unbecoming of an editor of an encyclopedia article.
::I was quoting his comment to me.
#Telling numskll to &quot;Please explain you justification for the mess you are making&quot; is in the least, not very diplomatic, and at worst uncivil and a personal attack.
::I wanted him to explain the mess he was making, rather than just revert war. I was actually being pretty restrained. 
# Accusing others of being sock-puppet is against wikipedia's civility policy, among others.
::I hope you will make the same comments to the users who regularly accuse me of being a sock puppet. Oh, wait. Of course you won't.
# Accusing my edits of being &quot;a slurry of rubbish&quot; is a personal attack.
::It's not. The edits were nonsense.
#Your comment &quot;Your continued attempts to sabotage this page are not appreciated&quot; is a personal attack, especially after I have explained to you why I am not trying to &quot;sabotage&quot; the article, but am trying to help.
::You admit you are trying to remove it.
#Calling a well-intentioned newcomer to the debate as spouting &quot;nonsense&quot; is uncivil. 
#Accusing someone of &quot;You admit to having an agenda to destroy this article based on your personal differences with some editors.&quot; is uncivil, especially when they claim does not appear to be true.
::It's not uncivil if they admit to having an agenda to destroy the article, and admit that it is based on personal differences with other editors.
# Your statement &quot;So butt out then If you're not interested in helping to build the encyclopedia, stop sowing disinformation and let others get on with it.&quot; is not civil.
::It's perfectly civil. The user had just explained that they had no interest in researching on that page. [[User:Gravitor|Gravitor]] 16:52, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
# Telling Wahkeenah &quot;you can't constantly spout rubbish that everyone knows is not true and expect people to believe you&quot; is a personal attack and not civil.
::It's a statement of fact.
#Telling Wahkeenah &quot;It looks like Wikipedia doesn't work the way you're used to at NASA - you can't just have someone 'disappeared' because they don't agree with your POV here.&quot; is uncivil, and potentially libelous. 
::No, it's not.
Your editing behavior is also very disruptive ([[WP:DE]]).
# Unilateral reverts to a non-consensus (or non-majority) version of the &quot;Independent evidence&quot; article is disruptive. You are reverting not only a single edit, but multiple edits at once. This hinders the rest of the community trying to improve this artile.
#Reverting with edit summaries such as &quot;see talk page&quot;, when you refuse to discuss your edits on the talk page is disruptive. I have been asking you for specific examples of why my edits are &quot;rubish&quot;, and you have yet to respond (excluding personal attacks, uncivil responses, and vague untrue statements).
#Renaming the page two times while the topic was being considered for a merge is disruptive.
# Your 3RR violations are disruptive.
# Placing a 3RR violation banner on my talk page (when I have reverted the article twice, both of which were explained on the talk page) certaintly violates some policy, and is an attempt to stymie my contributions to this article.
I think you get the point. I understand that this debate has become a bit heated, and that other users could perhaps be accused of making a personal attack from time to time, but you are displaying the worst behaviour of anyone that I have interacted with on Wikipedia since joining the community. I really would prefer not to take administrative action because (1) it is a waste of my time, and (2) should not be necessary considering that we are both adults (I am assuming that if you actually played the game gravitor, that you are far from being an adolescent teen). I am asking once again that you please try to remain calm when participating in debates and attempt to be civil. [[User:Lunokhod|Lunokhod]] 17:44, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks, but that's unnecessary to me. I was pushing civility to make all of you take stock and perspective. I just thought a blunt word might be helpful given the overall dynamics. I'd put in the time to read much of that, so figured it might help. 

:I'd considered that (your talk only), but the others needed to hear that too. Wasn't really meaning to come down on you in particular 'too hard' so much as to make the points generally, and you do seem embroiled in controversies every time I run across you -- mostly with a fairly rigid stance behind those positions... so relax a little, and live and let live. That's probably an unfair perception, but while I'm indeed guarded on that, as I teach my teens, &quot;Perceptions are other people's reality, and all they have to go bye when making judgment calls.&quot; At the very least, forgive it if offensive, as my intentions were good. By all means, use the Fact tagging.

:As someone who does their bit to spread [[WP:AMA|oil on troubled waters]], this sort of thing is endemic in Wikipedia when people have strong beliefs or take the guidelines too rigidly... which ignores the disclaimer each and everyone of the tags carries that editorial latitude is also part of the processes and society. Be well, sincere best wishes. Just remember your personal bottom line matters a whole lot more than whatever happens in this environment where everything is subject to change--being edited unmercifully '''is the bottom line''' after all. Until that changes, things will always be a little contentious if you let them drift that way. Just take your best shot, and hope some of what you do sticks.

But if you were to read the rest of the talk page, I don't see any examples of personal attacks, tendentious editing, trolling, and so on. As for wikilayering, you should realize that there is a merge proposal being considered, and the supermajority believe that this topic is in violation of wikipedia policy; the minority is wikilayering the meaning of &quot;consensus&quot;, and I know of no other way to deal with this than by citing wikipedia policy. Thanks again for the heads up. Just to let you know, I am in charge of the WikiMoon project and have been editing over 200 diffferent articles.

:::I don't care to go into particulars, as I should be outside taking advantage of the warm spell for a carpentry project... I've got 50 2X4's awaiting me in my van, and am trying to finish a couple of VPP posts of my own. Suffice it to say that the comments were as much directed at the others there as yourself, and I know you to be pretty meticulous over content and references from that VPP discussion on [[WP:OR]] and moon cycles, and what-not back in December. But do bear in mind the power of the fact tags... and the weakness of always resorting to external authority to make your points. ''&quot;A man convinced against his will is unconvinced still&quot;'', as Franklin says. So legalisms are a weak reed in my way of thinking. Better to appeal to common sense, and if there is dispute over fact and fancy, the fact tags should be hung for a time (A good month-- patience is very necessary in this society!) and when you edit out any not backed up, the grain remains, and the chaff goes in the midden, just as it's always been in mankinds affairs. Set up a sub-page of to do's or desk, and just cycle back through things rather than pushing for quick and easy resolutions when things get into oppositional situtations. I may counter argue something once if necessary to clarify a matter, and rarely do so more than that. Maybe one time out of a hundred, a second rejoiner/rebuttal. Both second and third posts, if any, I try to present a compromise or two I can accept, and what I most oppose, and let the crowd decide on that. Then just live with the outcome. The existence of any article here has legitimacy in my view, as [[WP:NOTE]] is the newest and weakest patch in a mess of many patches, and I frankly disagree with much of it. The motivation is a band-aid on a self-inflicted stabbing--the wikipedia open editing policy, and failure to lock articles when they are sufficiently matured. Until we stop sticking the knife in ourselves, things will continue to slide into a so-so article quality. What's really needed is a sit down strike by the long experience and most mature admins to get the foundation board members still with idealistic stars in their eyes crowd to revise policy. But that's my opinion, hardly holy writ! Cheers! // &lt;b&gt;[[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 20:44, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

==Conversion templates==
Hi, Lunokhod!  Thank you kindly for your feedback.  On documentation (mi|num vs. milnum), adding spaces on both sides of the pipe character should probably minimize the confusion&amp;rarr;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{km to mi | num=...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  I'll go through the documentation and fix it.

I also have no problem with creating additional templates (such as km to AU, kps to mph, etc.).  Just let me know which are the priority and which ones exactly you need.  I figured that units of length, area, and temperature were a no-brainer, so I made those first, but I have no clue as to what else people might want and/or use regularly.

Finally, regarding people pre-formatting the numbers, I am afraid this is not something that can be addressed.  You see, the set of functions available for template creation is extremely limited; it is certainly not even close to what's available in a full-fledged programming language.  We can only hope that when someone passes a pre-formatted number as a template parameter, s/he would double-check the result, see that it generates an error, make the corrections accordingly (and never pass pre-formatted numbers to a template parameter again :)).  In any case, it is probably a point worth including into documentation, so I will do that as well.

Let me know if you have any further concerns and/or suggestions, please.  Best,&amp;mdash;[[User:Ezhiki|Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)]]&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Ezhiki|yo?]]); 22:52, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

== I'm guessing we're on the same wavelength ==

Hi, I notice your desire to put imperial units of measurement in the Moon article, but yet you state you dislike them. I notice you state you have a Ph.D (in science presumably) and I myself am doing a Masters in astrophysics studying pulsars. Like you, I also like improving scientific wikipedia articles so the general public can get a grasp on some of the complex things we study.

We could argue forever the percentage of the population that use imperial units (be that native english speaking population vs world population vs english speaking or whatever) but I think that's not addressing the issue. My main issue is readability. When an article has lots of conversions in brackets it looks and reads just awful! And scientific articles tend to have lots of numbers. Also though I ask the question does it convey any useful information? For example (and this was actually done until I removed it) the sun's density was quoted as &quot;1.409 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1.88 x 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lb/US gallon)&quot;. This was just bizarre and totally useless. Endless sets of scientific numbers with miles, pounds, short-tons and fahrenheit sitting in brackets makes an awful mess. Is that what you think is really needed?

As I stated in Moon:Talk previously saying something like &quot;the nearest star is 4.3 light years (4.07 x 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; km) away&quot; is so much better than &quot;the nearest star is 4.3 light years (4.07 x 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; km, 2.52 x 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; miles) away&quot;. In fact I'd be supportive of leaving off the conversion to km as well - provided that light-year had been properly defined.

I'm asking to consider your goal of presenting scientific information in a way the user can understand. I'm really really sure that the percentage of the world's population that has no knowledge of a km and simply *must* have it in miles otherwise they'll leave the article would be insignificantly small. They would certainly be in the US only (and Burma and Liberia) and wikipedia is a worldwide tool. Not just a US tool.

We are scientists, we do everything in SI, have done for decades and life is so much easier for it.

My thoughts anyway.

Regards, [[User:Jim77742|Jim77742]] 03:48, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for your reply. The policy is that for scientific articles SI only is recommended. With consensus, imperial units can be removed. Keeping all astronomical bodies similar, consensus has been reached by many others to keep imperial units out of astronomical articles. As a major moon contributor you are part of that consensus. I would urge you to consider the usefulness of adding earth-moon distance in miles. I agree one or two conversions doesn't add too much clutter but that may open the floodgates for adding conversions everywhere. Why do you consider it important to have the earth-moon distance in miles? I'm trying, but I struggle to see its usefulness. (I'd much rather see a conversion to astronomical units in parenthesis than miles.)

Regards, [[User:Jim77742|Jim77742]] 23:37, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

Agree that article should not be addressed to scientists - but what I don't understand is why you don't consider SI as suitable for the masses? As you know they are so much easier to use. Regards, [[User:Jim77742|Jim77742]] 22:14, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

[[Discussion]] Do you have any strong opinions about the factuality or implications of the material presented in this wiki article? If so, please contribute. One contributor here would like to start a thread of conversation about the possibility of the phrases/terms 'being on the dole' and/or a person or the weather 'being in the doldrums' having their origin somehow connected with the dholak. What do you think? Is there any such basis in historical evidence and/or rhetorical etymology? How would you say has Indian and/or British society inculcated these terms with subjective qualities, either negative or condescending in their implications toward Indian folkloric drummers (e.g. did the expression &quot;to dole out&quot; [money] have a related origin)? Has such terminology either in literature or widespread casual-usage (vernacular) conversation contributed to strong negative social stereotypes (especially in relation to folkloric musicians and dancers) that persist? Can you cite written evidence?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Birthdate?==
The article says his birthdate is &quot;Born: December 31, 1900/January 1, 1901&quot;. Which is the right one? - [[User:Mskadu|Mayuresh]] 16:44, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

== Possibly Malicious Content / Citation Required ==
The following statement in this article requires a citation from a reliable source. The statement, and especially the way it has been worded, sounds malicious, is derogatory if untrue and is irrelevant in any case, and should not be included unless backed by a reliable and verifiable source.

'''Yesubai belonged to Devdasi tradition and was Ganesh Bhat's keep, so Dinanath was the son of a Karhade Brahmin, but he was not a Brahmin himself.'''

--[[User:CuriousChallenger|CuriousChallenger]] ([[User talk:CuriousChallenger|talk]]) 23:05, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

== Citation Still Required After Change ==

Cross-references do not seem to match for the following statement:

'''Ganesh Bhat-Nawathe, a priest and Yesubai Rane, a handmaiden of the deity Mangesh were his parents.'''

The Wiki article for Lata Mangeshkar claims that the original family name was Hardikar, which Mr. Deenanath subsequently changed to Mangeshkar for want of a prominent name. How can one's family name be Hardikar when the parents' family names are Nawathe and Rane respectively?

Also, the following sentences become irrelevant to the topic (especially in view of this challenge, but even otherwise):

'''Ganesh Bhat's legal family later changed the surname to Abhisheki because they were in-charge of pooja and abhishek at the local temple. Balasaheb Abhisheki was the son of Ganesh Bhat and his legal wife. Jitendra Abhisheki, Balabhau's son, also became a famous figure in music as composer and singer.'''

==Mentioning Caste==
Dear Editors!&lt;br&gt; There has been a discussion on India Portal related to mentioning of caste of subjects. The point is that mentioning caste of people, who have nothing to do with their caste, is found to be unnecessary by few editors. Hence the caste of the subject person needs to be deleted from the biography. I am not deleting the caste as of now but am only posting this here so that the regular editors of this article are well aware of it beforehand and no edit-wars take place. For details of discussion held on the portal please refer [[Wikipedia_talk:Noticeboard_for_India-related_topics#Mentioning_caste_of_Individuals]]. Your views if any are welcome there or even here. &lt;br&gt; And.... as the reasons of exclusion of caste pointed out were &quot;irrelavant to notability of subject person&quot;, &quot;privacy of the subject person&quot;, &quot;inclusion of caste is like branding individuals&quot;, etc. other information included in the article which also fall under these cases will also be removed after discussions. Examples of it included religion, non-notable spouse's and children's and parents' information, previous occupation, lived in places, non-notability related educational qualification, etc. &lt;br&gt; Your views on this are also welcome here or at the India portal. -[[User:Animeshkulkarni|Animeshkulkarni]] ([[User talk:Animeshkulkarni|talk]]) 16:57, 1 January 2012 (UTC)
:Not here, please. There is a community discussion taking place at [[WT:INB]] and I would advise people to read the entire discussion before forming an opinion because the above summary is incorrect. Nothing more need be said here. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 02:19, 4 January 2012 (UTC)</text>

The '''diamond industry of Israel''' is an important world player in producing cut [[diamond]]s for [[wholesale]]. In 2010, [[Israel]] became the chair of the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/138141 |title=Zimbabwe Diamond Activist Jailed before Israel Appearance |last=Miskin |first=Maayana |date=June 18, 2010 |work=[[Arutz Sheva]] |accessdate=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Jewish traditional craft===
Diamond cutting is a traditional Jewish craft with centuries of history. In the late 15th century, Jewish diamond cutter [[Lodewyk van Berken]] invented the [[scaif]] polishing wheel, a technological innovation that revolutionized the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/diamond/chap11.htm|title=Chapter Eleven - The Diamond Cut |website= www.edwardjayepstein.com |access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-state beginnings===
What was to become the Israeli diamond industry began in 1937, eleven years before [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|the State of Israel was established]], when the first diamond polishing plant was opened in [[Petah Tikva]] by refugee experts from the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1900to37&quot;&gt;[http://www.israelidiamond.co.il/english/news.aspx?boneID=1450 The Early 1900s] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061107080722/http://www.israelidiamond.co.il/English/NEWS.aspx?boneid=1450 |date=2006-11-07 }} by Shira Ami&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 the 15% import duty on imported rough stones was removed. By 1944 the industry employed 3,300 workers in 33 factories, with [[Palestine pound|£P]] 1,320,000 capital investment, entirely Jewish. The value of exports was over £P 3,200,000 mainly to the United States, Canada, and India; it was the largest value of any single commodity exported from [[Mandatory Palestine]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;'A survey of Palestine'. Vol 1. Originally published 1946-47. {{ISBN|0-88728-211-3}}. Page 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1944 and 1948 the industry suffered from the increasing lawlessness and in February 1948 closed down completely.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Scotsman]], March 8th 1948: '[[Clare Hollingworth]], Jerusalem, by Air Mail : One of the biggest casualties of the Palestine civil war occurred last month in a veil of obscurity. The entire Jewish-owned diamond polishing industry of Palestine, which had grown during the war to be the second largest in the world after that of Holland, was closed down. It is considered unlikely that the industry, which in 1946 exported £5,501,000 worth of cut diamonds, mostly to the United States, will reopen again on anything like its former scale. Four official reasons are given for ‘suspending work’. The first is that 2500 workers in 34 diamond-cutting plants walked out as a result of ‘hold-ups by dissident underground organisations.’ Secondly, Mr O. Ben-Ami, president of the Diamond Manufacturing Association, states that £200,000 of diamonds have been stolen since 1944. The third reason is that insurance companies, after raising diamond insurance rates for Palestine to 12 per cent. recently declined cover altogether. Fourthly, the Palestine Post Office no longer accepts registered mail. The fate of the diamond industry illustrates the twin dangers which threaten the whole of the new industrial system which the Zionists have built up rapidly in Palestine in recent years, and on which many Zionist economists based their hopes for the livelihood of a future Jewish state. The dangers are the dislocation caused by the guerrilla struggle waged by Jewish extremists, which has now developed into an economically paralysing civil war, and the post-war revival of international trade at competitive prices, which has revealed the shaky basis of wartime expansion of Zionist industry.'&lt;/ref&gt;

===First years of the State of Israel===
After a state was declared, the [[consumer economy]] was shifted to a war economy. This came at the height of a diamond crisis, as many war-torn economies were struggling to re-establish.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

During the first fifteen years of Israel's existence, diamonds and [[Jaffa oranges]] were the new state's main export products.&lt;ref&gt;Meirav Arlosoroff, [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/when-ben-gurion-saved-israel-s-economy-at-any-price-1.5936686  ''When Ben-Gurion Saved Israel’s Economy at Any Price''], [[Haaretz]], 23 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

After reaching its lowest point in the wake of the 1948 closedown,{{dubious|Logical gap. 1948 total closedown, then world-wide crisis - and suddenly talk of &quot;since then, the industry has continued to grow&quot;?!|date=March 2018}} the industry has continued to grow, producing a world leader in the diamond industry.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Current state==
In the beginning of the 21st century, Israel is one of the world's three major centers for polished [[diamonds]], alongside Belgium and India. Israel's net polished diamond exports slid 22.8% in 2012 as polished diamond exports fell to $5.56 billion from $7.2 billion in 2011. Net exports of rough diamonds dropped 20.1% to $2.8 billion and net exports of polished diamonds slipped 24.9 percent to $4.3 billion, while net rough diamond imports dropped 12.9 percent to $3.8 billion. The United States is the largest market accounting for 36% of overall export market for polished diamonds while Hong Kong remains at second with 28 percent and Belgium at 8% coming in third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewellerybusiness.com/newsletters/recent-news/335-january-21-2013/1396-israel-s-2012-polished-diamond-exports-decline Jewellery Business - Israel’s 2012 polished diamond exports decline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4332282,00.html | title=Diamond Exports | accessdate=January 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/02/uk-israel-diamonds-exports-idUKBRE9010CH20130102 Israel 2012 diamond exports fall, may rebound if no more crises | Reuters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamonds.net/News/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=41965&amp;ArticleTitle=Israel%27s+Polished+Diamond+Exports+-22%25+in+2012Diamonds.net - Israel's Polished Diamond Exports -22% in 2012&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, when diamonds still constituted almost 24% of Israel's total exports,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cOUq1JKeQ18C&amp;pg=SA47-PA7&amp; Minerals Yearbook, 2008, V. 3, Area Reports, International, Africa and the Middle East] - {{ISBN|9781411329652}} page 48.1 The mineral Industry of Israel: &quot;Israel's total exports amounted to $45.9 billion in 2007, of which diamonds accounted for 23.9%&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 12% of world diamonds (by their value) were polished in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cOUq1JKeQ18C&amp;pg=SA47-PA7&amp; Minerals Yearbook, 2008, V. 3, Area Reports, International, Africa and the Middle East] // USGS - {{ISBN|9781411329652}} page 48.1 The mineral Industry of Israel: &quot;In 2007 .. Israel accounted for 12% of the value of the world's polished diamond production&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 this number decreased to 9%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ugzj7nMxKi0C&amp;pg=SA48-PA1 Minerals Yearbook: Area Reports International Review 2010 Africa and the Middle East] // USGS - {{ISBN|9781411331747}} page 48.1  The mineral Industry of Israel: &quot;In 2010, Israel accounted for 9% of the value of the wolr's polished diamond production&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trading infrastructure==
{{further|Diamond Exchange District}}
The industry is located in the &quot;Diamond District&quot;, located in [[Ramat Gan]] in the [[Tel Aviv District]]. The complex is made up of four buildings, interconnected with walkways. The entire trading operation takes place in this complex.&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;[http://www.israel-diamonds.com Israel Diamond Industry Organizations]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106180157/http://www.israel-diamonds.com/ |date=January 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diamond Tower]] in the district contains the world's largest diamond trading floor.

[[Government of Israel|Israel's government]] funds a [[non-profit]] industry body, the [[Israel Diamond Institute]], to represent organisations and institutions involved in Israel's diamond industry.

==Industry principles==
The Israeli diamond industry guarantees all diamonds are 100% naturally made and participates in the Kimberley Process, a certification scheme whose goal is to ensure no [[blood diamonds]] enter the marketplace.&lt;ref name=Diamond/&gt;

==Fair use rationale for Image:SunValleySerenade.jpg==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:SunValleySerenade.jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:SunValleySerenade.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]]. If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.&lt;!-- Template:Missing rationale2 --&gt;

==What to do?==

Step one is to write some sensible stuff on your user page. Wikipedians are often suspicious of &quot;red users&quot;, as they have a habit of being trouble-makers who make accounts without having any positive intentions. Telling the community about yourself should make it easier for people to like you - no offence, but people often don't realise this.

Step two is to get contributing generally (and improving, not just tagging for deletion). Again, people don't like users who create accounts to resolve issues like this. It will help if you get a reputation as someone who is proactive in improving things, not just here to get things deleted. There are lots of articles on Japan which could use improving.

Step three is to identify all plagarised articles. If articles have plagarised sections, merely remove the text and then explain (concisely) why you're doing it on the talk page.

Step four is to list the articles for deletion, as you have done here. But don't list all of them in one go, do them in batches. Make sure to match up articles that should be deleted for the same reason. Only list for deletion if the whole thing is plagarised. If there is salvageable stuff there, reduce the article - put a stub tag on if you have to. Or you can just give the list to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nagaeyari LordAmeth], who seems to be willing to help.

Step five is to notify the Japanese history community about the deletions and ask for their comments (not help in deleting it, as that's frowned upon). [[User:John Smith's|John Smith&amp;#39;s]] 12:57, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

'''Marion Junior/Senior High School''' is a [[high school]] in [[Marion, Wisconsin]] that serves students in grades [[Seventh grade|7]] through [[Twelfth grade|12]]. It has an enrollment of approximately 200 students.  The school colors are blue and gold and the mascot is a Mustang.

==Marion School District==
The school district comprises territory along the boundary of Shawano and Waupaca counties, and includes the communities of [[Caroline, Wisconsin|Caroline]], [[Leopolis, Wisconsin|Leopolis]], and the Town of [[Pella, Wisconsin|Pella]]. At one time, Caroline had its own elementary school, however, because of small enrollment it was sold to the local American Legion group. Students from Caroline have attended Marion's elementary school since the early 1980s.

Although Marion has had several high school and elementary buildings in its history, the main building has usually been on School Street in downtown Marion. The elementary school and the high school were at one time in the same building. A fire in 1985 caused high school classes to be moved to the elementary school, while elementary classes were moved to various locations around Marion, such as churches, while a new high school, connected to the old gymnasium, was built on School Street. The separate elementary building for K-6 is located five blocks north of the junior-senior high school, just off Main Street. A field house was added to the elementary school in 1998, where many events are now held.

==Extracurricular activities==
Marion High School has extracurricular programs, such as music, [[National FFA Organization|FFA]], FCCLA, forensics, and other academic groups. Every year, students represent the school at state and national levels in FFA, as well as at state competitions in music and forensics.

===Athletics===
Marion High School participates in the Central Wisconsin Conference - small division, or CWC-Small, in the following sports: cross country, football, volleyball, basketball, baseball, softball, golf, and track and field. Local churches and groups also sponsor summer baseball and softball teams and tournaments.

====Wrestling====
Although Marion High School discontinued its wrestling program because of declining participation, the school had its first state champion in 1997. 

In February 2015, Marion approved a wrestling co-op with the neighboring city o [[Clintonville, Wisconsin|Clintonville]].{{cn|date=June 2015}}

====Track and field====
A Marion High School pole vaulter took first at the state meet in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsintrackandfield.com/listsrecords/boystopPV.html Wisconsin High School Track and Field records&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cross country====
The cross country program was discontinued for many years because of declining involvement, however, it experienced a resurgence in the late 1990s. This was followed by the boys' team finishing seventh at the state meet in 1997.

====Softball====
The softball team won the state tournament in the early 1990s{{when|date=August 2016}}.

====Baseball====
The baseball team captured its first WIAA State Championship in 2009.

Ken Frailing of the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Chicago Cubs]] is a Marion High School graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/submit/Sargent_Jim8.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011134529/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/submit/Sargent_Jim8.stm |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Golf====
With the building of Marion's first community golf course, Perry's Landing, a golf team was started. The golf season is in the spring and allows boys and girls to play.

====Basketball====
The girls' basketball team lost to [[Iola, Wisconsin|Iola]] in the regional playoffs in 2000. It won the CWC-10 Conference championship in 2014. 

The boys' basketball team, in both the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons, lost in the sectional finals, capping 21-win seasons. The 2011-12 team's sectional loss was to Sam Dekker and the Sheboygan Lutheran Crusaders. Sam went on to star for the Wisconsin Badgers and the Houston Rockets.

[[Dick Bennett]], former basketball coach at the [[University of Wisconsin–Green Bay]], [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and [[Washington State University]], began his basketball coaching career at Marion High School.

====Football====
Marion had no varsity football victories from the 1999 season finale until 2004. Marion won two games that year. Beginning in the 2009 season, the football team combined with Tigerton High School. The co-op team is known as the Marion-Tigerton Thundercatz. The co-op was created because of declining participation for both schools.

Please [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign your name]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your name and the date.

It is felt that the article you created at [[Mitch Kusbel]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. [[User:Fan-1967|Fan-1967]] 20:19, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

== 8 Members? 7 Names? ==

There are 8 members in the picture, only 7 listed in the &quot;band members&quot; section!
The missing member is Gaurav &quot;Gary&quot; Misra.  I'd edit it myself but I can't find any mention of him on the Mehfuz website (also pictures only show 7 guys).  He was definitley part of the first few albums.  Not sure if there was a falling out, and if so when that happened.

Someone might want to check up on that.


 What happened that there are now 7 members from 8 perviously.  Some history of the band would be nice.

Gaurav MIsra has left the band.
