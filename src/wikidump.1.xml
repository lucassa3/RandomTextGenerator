The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.  His mom remarried and had another child, a daughter named Brittani (Gamble).</text>

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Results of the third [[WP:DC|Danny's Contest]]==
__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Criterion
!Description
!Weight
|-
|'''Number of citations'''
|Just a  raw count of how many were added. This was a good filter to see if the article could make the finalists... only 2 or 3 refs suggested that maybe not so much had been done.	
|(20%)
|-
|'''Complexity of citations'''
|A gauge of the difficulty level of adding them. Were they notes? web cites? book cites? did they use ISBN tagging? were there multiple places that got the same note? Notes ON notes? 
|(30%)
|-
|'''Appropriateness of cites'''
|Were they actually GOOD cites that moved the article forward?
|(20%)	
|-
|'''Overall article improvement'''
|How much was the article helped (expanded, quality increased, made more pleasing to the eye) by cites added? 
|(30%)
|}

===Finalists===
The three most impressive articles were as follows... ANY of them could easily be FA candidates shortly.

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|[[User:Robth|Robth]]
|-
|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

That all of these articles were somehow military related was surely coincidence! :)
